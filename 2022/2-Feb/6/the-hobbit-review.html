        <p>What an enjoyable read, a true classic fantasy story. A true adventure story, and an amazing tale that changed the world.</p>
        
        <p>My one criticism would have to be the ending. It seemed a bit rushed, after so much time to be so quick, it seemed disconnected almost.</p>
        
        <p>The singing and the ending were what brought this to a 4/5 for me. The singing took me out of the story, I didn’t want to read that as I was reading this story. I’d rather read the story!</p>

        <p><em>Started Reading February 26, 2024</em></p>
        <p>I can certainly say, the Hobbit is one of my favorite books I've ever read. I know it's a "children's fantasy story" but it is really a fun and exciting story. The plot is wonderful, the prose is beautiful, the world-building is just awesome. I love this story so much!</p>
        
        <p>This is a classic, written in the 1930s... that is AMAZING! This was a book I really wanted to read, when I started reading fantasy, and ahh, I'm just so happy reading this. I have always loved dragons, and this is a great dragon! The characters are funny, and thoughtful, and smart, and really do work together. The plot is something I always think about.</p>
            
        <p>Bilbo is such an enjoyable protagonist. The also really enjoy this narrative style. Ah, this just such a good read! This story has been something that I've known about for many years now, and I don't think it's perfect, but I am very pleased reading this story. There isn't too much fluff in this story, and I appreciate the pacing of the story.</p>
            
        <p>I do really enjoy the progression of the plot throughout this story. It's fun and exciting, and it really shows the thought behind the world and the magic. I'm a huge fan of magic. </p>
            
        <p>I also really enjoy the comedy here, it's not everywhere but when it's there, it's good!</p>
            
        <p>This is such an incredible story. Short and simple, powerful, epic, magical. Exciting! I'm so happy this was written and I'm so excited to be back in the Lord of the Rings world!</p>

        <p><em>Flames unquenchable sprang high into the night. Another swoop and another, and another house and then another sprange afire and fell; and still no arrow hindered Smaug or hurt him more than a fly from the marshes.</em></p>
