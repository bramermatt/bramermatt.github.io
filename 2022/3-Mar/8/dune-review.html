    <h2 id="written">Written Review</h2>
    <p>Dune. A long book, 617 pages. An incredible story, amazing characters, a rich world; with so much more to tell with many more books! A delight to read, and a real page-turner. A 5/5 for me, I look forward to reading more in this universe.</p>

        <summary>Notes from my reading</summary>

        <p>A great start!</p>
    
        <p>28. This is a world I’m dying to get lost in. Transport me to this world. I want to mainline this book into my veins. Granted, I’m 28 pages in.</p>
        
        <p>98. Here we go! I am thoroughly enjoying this book. Such a world has been built by Frank Herbert. A stellar book so far!</p>
        
        <p>253. Onto Book Two: Mau’d Dib. Wow. This book is absolutely enthralling. I cannot wait to turn page after page. Herbert writes like I’ve never read before. There is so much to this story, I want to devour it. I am amazed by how characters interact, and I want to be apart of this world. I want to know what’s happening. Here we go!</p>
