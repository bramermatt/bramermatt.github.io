                <h1>Hi, I'm Matthew Bramer</h1>
                <p>I'm a husband, father, Jesus follower, and a  Computer Science student at SNHU.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-550">
                <h3>About Me</h3>
                    <p>Hello! I'm a passionate web developer with a diverse set of skills and interests. Currently, I’m working on various exciting projects that range from mobile app development to SQL database management.</p>

                    <h4>Professional Background</h4>
                    <p>I am about to graduate with a Computer Science degree, and I've dedicated much of my time to applying my academic knowledge to practical applications. As I transition to new roles at work, I aim to prepare my successor with the knowledge I've acquired, complete outstanding tasks, and document processes thoroughly. My goal is to continuously learn and train for new roles, ensuring I stay ahead in the ever-evolving tech landscape.</p>

                    <!-- <h4>Current Projects</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Mobile App Development:</strong> I'm developing an iOS app that suggests wardrobe options based on weather, occasion, and user inspiration. The app includes features like wardrobe inventory, shopping, and social interactions.</li>
                        <li><strong>SQL Database Management:</strong> Utilizing my subscription to JMP, I visualize and manage data using SQL, a language I find both fun and intuitive.</li>
                        <li><strong>C++ Enhancements:</strong> I’m enhancing a Binary Search Tree program and optimizing search algorithms.</li>
                        <li><strong>Web Development:</strong> I'm creating a dynamic updated website for my Church (One Community Church Indiana), and I'm constantly trying to improve my skills while improving my personal website.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Personal Interests</h4>
                    <p>Outside of my professional work, I have a variety of interests:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Tee Ball Coaching:</strong> I was able to coach my son's tee ball team this year! I love baseball, and I had never coached before, so this was a really incredible opportunity for both myself, and my son. I certainly enjoyed being back on the baseball diamond, but spending that time with my son, wife, and our daughter, and even our son's new friends was amazing. I worked hard to create an environment of fun, while still learning and developing skills to be better baseball players, teammates, and friends. I think I impacted these kids and I hope they have a deeper love for the game!</li>
                        <li><strong>Reading:</strong> I’m an avid reader and lover of all things FANTASY! I also love Jesus and love to read my Bible! It is my goal to get as many people who are followers of Jesus to really enjoy reading through the Old Testament of the Bible. I don't fully understand the Old Testament and I understand reading the Bible to be a daunting task, but I love it.</li>
                        <li><strong>Podcast Enthusiast:</strong> Speaking of reading the Bible, I also love listening to Bible podcasts! I am an a huge fan of the Bible Project and their Bible Project Podcast. I also enjoy documentary podcasts about apps and businesses, such as "How I Built This" and "Land of the Giants."</li>
                    </ul> -->

                    <h4>Personal Life</h4>
                    <p>I’m 27 years old, happily married to my wonderful wife who is 28, and we have a delightful 4-year-old son and a now 8-month-old daughter. Balancing family life with my professional and personal interests is something I take pride in. I'm not always the best father, or husband, but I am constantly trying to improve myself.</p>

                    <h4>Future Goals</h4>
                    <p>Looking ahead, I aim to deepen my knowledge of JavaScript, design a blog layout that resonates with my vision, and explore new ways to integrate technology into everyday solutions. I am also passionate about using my skills to make a positive impact and help others in the tech community.</p>
