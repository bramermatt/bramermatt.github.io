<p>Please be careful what you click, I will be writing my Notes As I Read below, but they are hidden so that you have to click on them to see. Be careful!</p>

    <summary>Notes As I Read</summary>

    <h2>Header</h2>
    <p>
    "It soon became obvious, even within the stedding, that the Pattern was
    growing frail. The sky darkened. Our dead appeared, standing in rings
    outside the borders of the stedding, looking in. Most troublingly, trees fell ill,
    and no song would heal them.</p>

    <p>It was in this time of sorrows that I stepped up to the Great Stump. At first, I
    was forbidden, but my mother, Covril, demanded I have my chance. I do not
    know what sparked her change of heart, as she herself had argued quite
    decisively for the opposing side. My hands shook. I would be the last
    speaker, and most seemed to have already made up their minds to open the
    Book of Translation. They considered me an afterthought.</p>

    <p>And I knew that unless I spoke true, humanity would be left alone to face the
    Shadow. In that moment, my nervousness fled. I felt only a stillness, a calm
    sense of purpose. I opened my mouth, and I began to speak.</p>

    <p>—from The Dragon Reborn, by Loial, son of Arent, son of Halan, of Stedding Shangtai-</p>

    <h2>Prologue, Distinctions, Wheel</h2>
    <p><strong>Lan.</strong> Lan! Lan is riding Mandarb across the Proska Flats in northern Saldaea near the Blight. He hasn't seen people or Trollocs in days. Lan prepares an arrow and a man walks up leading a pack horse, he expected to see Lan on the Kremer Road, this is Bulen, Lan's retainer years ago in the Aesdaishar Palace.. nice name. Lan refuses, but decides once Bulen says his father was Malkier, Bulen needs permission to don the hadori, Lan relents and the two travel on.</p>

    <p>Perrin. Apparenlty Perrin is dreaming a normal dream.. hmm. Hopper is there. Perrin is thinking about Berelain and Faile. Perrin is now back in Malden carrying his axe instead of hammer.. he remembers the fight differently, he  refuses to kill Aram but then an image of Perrin splits off and turns into a wolf and kills Aram. Hopper slams into Perrin after Perrin makes more statues of people he knows. </p>

    <p>He wakes up and he is in his tent with Faile, there have been bubbles of evil that made red snakes poison hundreds, the Aes Sedai couldn't completely Heal them. It then takes Perrni a long time to go back to sleep.</p>

    <p><strong>Graendal.</strong> Holy smokes, this is how the DO uses rats as spies... hahaha for the entirety of this book series I assumed the rats could talk.... hahahahahah. Okay, this was incredible, unexpected and interesting! We are back in time, Graendal is in Natrin's Barrow with Aran'gar, Delana, and hundreds of servants. Graendal now has access to the True Power - the TP strains and scars the Pattern. What the Creator can create, the DO can destroy.</p>

    <p>Ramshalan comes in, Delana weaves Compusion on him. Graendal uses the True Power to take over the mind of a dove. Graendal wonders if LTT remembers her murder of Yanet. The dove sees Ramshalan, Rand, Nynaeve, and the Aiel. Rand weaves balefire and Graendal freaks out! Wraps Aran'gar and Delana in Air and opens a gateway with saidar. She jumps through and sees a flash of light and the gateway disappears. She feels the balescrem from the massive use of balefire. She is safe because Rand thinks she is dead. WHOA! Unexpected! - and yes I have to update my Forsaken count..</p>

    <p><strong>Galad.</strong> Okay, Galad was called a darkfriend by Asunawa. The Questioners arrested him. Asunawa fled when Galad beat Valda in KOD (I think.)</p>

    <p><strong>Padan Fain.</strong> Good-NESS lol. The creature formally known as.. Fain / Mordeth, yikes. The sky is black. Fain keeps cutting himself. He thinks he needs a new name. He just killed a Worm. They make a lot of noise. Then mist comes out of the ground and kills a Fade and turns the Trollocs with the fade into something crazy. Fain doesn't hunt Rand, he is going to meet him at Shayol Ghul and kill him! </p>

    <p><strong>Melanarin.</strong> Oh that was beautiful. Keemlin gets his sword before his nameday to become a MAN! Malenarin is commander of Heeth Tower, the northernmost tower near the Blight in Kandor. They use a cool system with mirrors and lamps to shout danger for nearby towers. Trollocs come in hordes! </p>

    <p><em>Also, dang it.. undulating count: 1. actually 2. 2 in one POV.</em></p>

<h2>Ch 1, Apples First, Dragon's Fang</h2>
<p><strong>Almen Bunt.</strong> I thought I recognized that name.. Bunt. THIS WAS THE MAN WHO HID RAND AND MAT IN THE EYE OF THE WORLD!! Wow, so cool. Also, Rand has a lightness around Rand now instead of darkness.. interesting. </p>

<p>Wind rises above the misty peaks of Imfaral, there are thirteen tall, black fortresses. Seanchan is in chaos. The Fields of Peace are burning and the Tower of Raves is broken. A murder rules in Seandar.. oh really??</p>

<p>The Wind blows to an apple orchard below Dragonmount. Almen Bunt is there. Everythign is hagard and wilting. People and names, apple are gross and rotting... Then Rand shows up, and my guess is Rand is going to see Egwene! Rand leaves in his path an abundance of healthy apples and green grass. Rand thinks who he goes to see will not be pleased, is he in for a rude awakening or what?!</p>

<p>Almen feels better than he has in years. He calls the farm hands to gather people from the villages, even those passing on Shyman's Road, to help pick the apples. He feels something tugging him after the young man, but he will take care of the apples first.</p>

<h2>Ch 2, Questions of Leadership, Wolf</h2>
<p><strong>Perrin.</strong> I do declare, the Pattern wants Perrin to bring an incredibly massive fighting force to Rand. The gateway boys won't be able to gateway for sometime - in my estimation, and Perrin's army is going to be HUGE. That is all. Also, "there is something you need to see".</p>

<p><strong>Galad.</strong> Asunawa = Dead. </p>

<p>Galad wakes from his beating. He has many sharp pains in addition to the still-healing wounds from Valda. He is in a tent bound to a stake. He hears voices outside the tent; the flaps open and, to his surprise, it is Trom, Bornhald and Byar. Lords Captain Kazere Tethow, Alaabar Harnesh and Brandel Vordarian are with them. After thinking through the arguments they decided Galad was in the right. They executed Asunawa and the Whitecloaks are now united behind Galad. Candeiar enters to tend his wounds. They will march to Andor.</p>

<h2>Ch 3, The Amyrlin's Anger, Flame</h2>
<p><strong>Egwene.</strong> Oh yes, here we go! Egwene wants Nynaeve and Elayne to swear on the OR - I agree. She also needs to let them know about Elaida (collared). She then dreams of Gawyn then BOOM.</p>

<p>Dreams of thirteen black towers (seanchan) falling down. Then eagles and snakes. Then An enormous sphere made of the finest crystal on a dark hilltop. It sparkles in the light of twenty-three enormous stars. There are cracks in it and it is help together by ropes. Rand walks up with a woodsman axe and chops the ropes. The sphere breaks apart, falling to pieces and Rand shakes his head. Which is awesome, I'm reminded of the Bore.. hope to see more of that.</p>

<p>Rand is here to meet Egwene.</p>

<p><strong>Siuan.</strong> Oh why yes, thank you! This is great! Rand is in the Tower. Gawyn is trying his best to rekindle the trust with Egwene. Siuan thinks Egwene is an incredible Amyrlin. Rand enters shielded by 26 Aes Sedai and guarded by 100 Warder. His eyes look ageless. Rand speaks to Siuan and Bryne and thanks Siuan for taking an arrow meant for him (TGH!). Tiana runs up and hands Rand a letter with a red seal.. interesting. Rand asks Siuan to calm Egwene once he leaves.. oh boy lol.</p>

<p><strong>Egwene.</strong> Oh this is so good! Rand comes in calm as can be. And proceeds to tell Egwene nearly everything she needs to know.</p>

<p>Rand speaks philosophically and Egwene worries that he is mad. She says she will have sisters examine him but he refuses. He tells her the last time he failed was because he used only men. It will take both saidin and saidar to seal the Bore. He says he remembers being Lews Therin like a dream.</p>

<p>He says he will go to Shayol Ghul in one month and break the remaining seals. He must clear the rubble, open the Bore fully, before it can be sealed again. He will meet them at the Field of Merrilor one day before. She thinks of her dream of him letting the sphere break. He asks leave to depart and turns to go. She sees his left hand is missing. After he is gone, the Sitters slump in their seats. Silviana, Barasine and Yukiri say could not speak for his ta'veren effect. Chubain reports that Bryne is following Rand to make sure he leaves. Egwene says they need allies to stop him from breaking the seals.</p>

<h2>Ch 4, The Pattern Groans, Pattern</h2>
<p><strong>Perrin.</strong> Hmm, Perrin riding Stayer is at the Jehannah Road with Faile, Wil, Seonid and the six Wise Ones, Nevarin. Berelain, Annoura Gallenne are also there. Alliandre stayed behind. A patch of the Blight has transplanted there. Mori examined the entire patch. They ride into the patch and find a strange village in the middle. Sulin reports that no one is there. Masuri says that the wood and thatch are something she has never seen. Perrin orders the Wise Ones to burn the whole area.</p>

<p>Oh wow, Perrin. I think I'm interested in your storyline now! Perrin wakes in the Wolf Dream! Perrin keeps fighting the urge to be his Young Bull wolf form. Perrin then sees visions - Mat fighting against himself, 12 different men wearing his face, a shadowy figure behind him comes with a bloody knife. - Sheeps running towards the woods chased by wolves, there is a terrible beaset in the woods and something is wrong with the wolves. - File, Grady, Elyas, and Gual followed by thousands walk toward a cliff. Whoa.</p>

<p>Perrin then chases a stag as Young Bull, bites it, then Hopper explains not to kill it here. And then Perrin agrees to let Hopper teach him his way... here we go!</p>

<p><strong>Galad.</strong> Oh heck, Dain Bornhald "he killed my father". Also, am I missing something, where is Morgase / Maighdin?? Is she not with Gill? </p>

<p>Galad is near the Jehannah Road... he has a message to send to the other Questioners about Asunawa - requesting they report to Galad. Also, Galad wants to ally with the Aes Sedai before the Last Battle - smart! Basel Gill is stopped by crew and they're seperating them all to see if their stories match up.</p>

<h2>Ch 5, Writings, Forsnaken</h2>
<p><strong>Gawyn.</strong> Dang it. I feel so simple-minded when I'm in Gawyn's head lol. He is going to do something very stupid... I feel it in my bones. Also, Mesaana is the assassin, I can't wait to find out who she has been masquarading as.</p>

<p>I'm interested in this plan for the AS bonding Warders. I think it's important - the Last Battle *is* coming..</p>

<p><strong>Egwene.</strong> Egwene, please don't turn people against Rand. The Seals are important to break, right? Also, why are you drinking mint tea Egwene?!</p>

<p><strong>Graendal.</strong> Whoa... Let's break this craziness down. Wow. I truly don't think Perrin will die. But who could her spies be?? Gotta be Dain Bornhold maybe, or Annoura?? oooo that'd be a twist!</p>

<p>Graendal is hiding on an island in the Aryth Ocean with only six of her pets, one a Tairen High Lady. A gateway takes her to Moridin's fortress. He is angry that Aran'gar is dead. Moridin says he will leave her without punishment and she wonders if that was a direct order from the DO or Shaidar Haran. he orders her to stay away from Rand, she says she will bring Perrin's head. She has spies and knows where his army is and she has planned a trap with her Shadowspawn army.</p>

<p>Moridin takes her to a storeroom with OP objects including three binders, a shocklance, a rema'kar, and a dreamspike - Moridin has two dreamspikes. Whatever the heck that means lol. A shocklance, we've heard that before TSR I think, Rand's Rhu visions. Moridin gives Graendal the dreamspike and warns her against using it against him.. and gives her the man with two souls.. SLAYER / LUC / ISAM! He tells her she will be greatly rewarded if she kills Perrin. He shows her a book of Dark Prophecies that says that Perrin will die. Moridin sends her back to the island, she can still touch the True Power a bit.</p>

<h2>Ch 6, Questioning Intentions, Blacksmith Puzzle</h2>
<p><strong>Morgase.</strong> Ask and I shall recieved.. Morgase! And so, we're sending a group to Cairhien, Edarra has suggested linking with the Asha'man to help with the gateways. The group to Cairhien includes.. Seonid, her Warder, two Maidens, Pel Aydaer, Cameaille Nolaisen, and Balwer lol, what a crew.</p>

<p>I love the interest Morgase has taken in serving drinks lol. Also, I certainly thought we were getting a marriage here! Tallanvor and Morgase sitting in a tree..</p>

<p>There have been a lot of chapters ending with.. "you've got to see this", "there's someone up the road", "and they knew just what to do..". Just an observation. Seems very middle trilogy book to me.</p>
