    <summary>Notes As I Read</summary>

    <h2>Header</h2>
    <p>"It soon became obvious, even within the stedding, that the Pattern was
        growing frail. The sky darkened. Our dead appeared, standing in rings
        outside the borders of the stedding, looking in. Most troublingly, trees fell ill,
        and no song would heal them.</p>

        <p>It was in this time of sorrows that I stepped up to the Great Stump. At first, I
        was forbidden, but my mother, Covril, demanded I have my chance. I do not
        know what sparked her change of heart, as she herself had argued quite
        decisively for the opposing side. My hands shook. I would be the last
        speaker, and most seemed to have already made up their minds to open the
        Book of Translation. They considered me an afterthought.</p>

        <p>And I knew that unless I spoke true, humanity would be left alone to face the
        Shadow. In that moment, my nervousness fled. I felt only a stillness, a calm
        sense of purpose. I opened my mouth, and I began to speak.</p>

        <p>—from The Dragon Reborn, by Loial, son of Arent, son of Halan, of Stedding Shangtai-</p></p>
