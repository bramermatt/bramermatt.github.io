<h2>Spoilers From Here On</h2>
<p>Please be careful what you click, I will be writing my Notes As I Read below, but they are hidden so that you have to click on them to see. Be careful!</p>

    <summary>Notes As I Read</summary>

    <h2>Header</h2>
    <p>
    "It soon became obvious, even within the stedding, that the Pattern was
    growing frail. The sky darkened. Our dead appeared, standing in rings
    outside the borders of the stedding, looking in. Most troublingly, trees fell ill,
    and no song would heal them.</p>

    <p>It was in this time of sorrows that I stepped up to the Great Stump. At first, I
    was forbidden, but my mother, Covril, demanded I have my chance. I do not
    know what sparked her change of heart, as she herself had argued quite
    decisively for the opposing side. My hands shook. I would be the last
    speaker, and most seemed to have already made up their minds to open the
    Book of Translation. They considered me an afterthought.</p>

    <p>And I knew that unless I spoke true, humanity would be left alone to face the
    Shadow. In that moment, my nervousness fled. I felt only a stillness, a calm
    sense of purpose. I opened my mouth, and I began to speak.</p>

    <p>—from The Dragon Reborn, by Loial, son of Arent, son of Halan, of Stedding Shangtai-</p>

    <h2>Prologue, Distinctions, Wheel</h2>
    <p><strong>Lan.</strong> Lan! Lan is riding Mandarb across the Proska Flats in northern Saldaea near the Blight. He hasn't seen people or Trollocs in days. Lan prepares an arrow and a man walks up leading a pack horse, he expected to see Lan on the Kremer Road, this is Bulen, Lan's retainer years ago in the Aesdaishar Palace.. nice name. Lan refuses, but decides once Bulen says his father was Malkier, Bulen needs permission to don the hadori, Lan relents and the two travel on.</p>

    <p>Perrin. Apparenlty Perrin is dreaming a normal dream.. hmm. Hopper is there. Perrin is thinking about Berelain and Faile. Perrin is now back in Malden carrying his axe instead of hammer.. he remembers the fight differently, he  refuses to kill Aram but then an image of Perrin splits off and turns into a wolf and kills Aram. Hopper slams into Perrin after Perrin makes more statues of people he knows. </p>

    <p>He wakes up and he is in his tent with Faile, there have been bubbles of evil that made red snakes poison hundreds, the Aes Sedai couldn't completely Heal them. It then takes Perrni a long time to go back to sleep.</p>

    <p><strong>Graendal.</strong> Holy smokes, this is how the DO uses rats as spies... hahaha for the entirety of this book series I assumed the rats could talk.... hahahahahah. Okay, this was incredible, unexpected and interesting! We are back in time, Graendal is in Natrin's Barrow with Aran'gar, Delana, and hundreds of servants. Graendal now has access to the True Power - the TP strains and scars the Pattern. What the Creator can create, the DO can destroy.</p>

    <p>Ramshalan comes in, Delana weaves Compusion on him. Graendal uses the True Power to take over the mind of a dove. Graendal wonders if LTT remembers her murder of Yanet. The dove sees Ramshalan, Rand, Nynaeve, and the Aiel. Rand weaves balefire and Graendal freaks out! Wraps Aran'gar and Delana in Air and opens a gateway with saidar. She jumps through and sees a flash of light and the gateway disappears. She feels the balescrem from the massive use of balefire. She is safe because Rand thinks she is dead. WHOA! Unexpected! - and yes I have to update my Forsaken count..</p>

    <p><strong>Galad.</strong> Okay, Galad was called a darkfriend by Asunawa. The Questioners arrested him. Asunawa fled when Galad beat Valda in KOD (I think.)</p>

    <p><strong>Padan Fain.</strong> Good-NESS lol. The creature formally known as.. Fain / Mordeth, yikes. The sky is black. Fain keeps cutting himself. He thinks he needs a new name. He just killed a Worm. They make a lot of noise. Then mist comes out of the ground and kills a Fade and turns the Trollocs with the fade into something crazy. Fain doesn't hunt Rand, he is going to meet him at Shayol Ghul and kill him! </p>

    <p><strong>Melanarin.</strong> Oh that was beautiful. Keemlin gets his sword before his nameday to become a MAN! Malenarin is commander of Heeth Tower, the northernmost tower near the Blight in Kandor. They use a cool system with mirrors and lamps to shout danger for nearby towers. Trollocs come in hordes! </p>

    <p><em>Also, dang it.. undulating count: 1. actually 2. 2 in one POV.</em></p>

<h2>Ch 1, Apples First, Dragon's Fang</h2>
<p><strong>Almen Bunt.</strong> I thought I recognized that name.. Bunt. THIS WAS THE MAN WHO HID RAND AND MAT IN THE EYE OF THE WORLD!! Wow, so cool. Also, Rand has a lightness around Rand now instead of darkness.. interesting. </p>

<p>Wind rises above the misty peaks of Imfaral, there are thirteen tall, black fortresses. Seanchan is in chaos. The Fields of Peace are burning and the Tower of Raves is broken. A murder rules in Seandar.. oh really??</p>

<p>The Wind blows to an apple orchard below Dragonmount. Almen Bunt is there. Everythign is hagard and wilting. People and names, apple are gross and rotting... Then Rand shows up, and my guess is Rand is going to see Egwene! Rand leaves in his path an abundance of healthy apples and green grass. Rand thinks who he goes to see will not be pleased, is he in for a rude awakening or what?!</p>

<p>Almen feels better than he has in years. He calls the farm hands to gather people from the villages, even those passing on Shyman's Road, to help pick the apples. He feels something tugging him after the young man, but he will take care of the apples first.</p>

<h2>Ch 2, Questions of Leadership, Wolf</h2>
<p><strong>Perrin.</strong> I do declare, the Pattern wants Perrin to bring an incredibly massive fighting force to Rand. The gateway boys won't be able to gateway for sometime - in my estimation, and Perrin's army is going to be HUGE. That is all. Also, "there is something you need to see".</p>

<p><strong>Galad.</strong> Asunawa = Dead. </p>

<p>Galad wakes from his beating. He has many sharp pains in addition to the still-healing wounds from Valda. He is in a tent bound to a stake. He hears voices outside the tent; the flaps open and, to his surprise, it is Trom, Bornhald and Byar. Lords Captain Kazere Tethow, Alaabar Harnesh and Brandel Vordarian are with them. After thinking through the arguments they decided Galad was in the right. They executed Asunawa and the Whitecloaks are now united behind Galad. Candeiar enters to tend his wounds. They will march to Andor.</p>

<h2>Ch 3, The Amyrlin's Anger, Flame</h2>
<p><strong>Egwene.</strong> Oh yes, here we go! Egwene wants Nynaeve and Elayne to swear on the OR - I agree. She also needs to let them know about Elaida (collared). She then dreams of Gawyn then BOOM.</p>

<p>Dreams of thirteen black towers (seanchan) falling down. Then eagles and snakes. Then An enormous sphere made of the finest crystal on a dark hilltop. It sparkles in the light of twenty-three enormous stars. There are cracks in it and it is help together by ropes. Rand walks up with a woodsman axe and chops the ropes. The sphere breaks apart, falling to pieces and Rand shakes his head. Which is awesome, I'm reminded of the Bore.. hope to see more of that.</p>

<p>Rand is here to meet Egwene.</p>

<p><strong>Siuan.</strong> Oh why yes, thank you! This is great! Rand is in the Tower. Gawyn is trying his best to rekindle the trust with Egwene. Siuan thinks Egwene is an incredible Amyrlin. Rand enters shielded by 26 Aes Sedai and guarded by 100 Warder. His eyes look ageless. Rand speaks to Siuan and Bryne and thanks Siuan for taking an arrow meant for him (TGH!). Tiana runs up and hands Rand a letter with a red seal.. interesting. Rand asks Siuan to calm Egwene once he leaves.. oh boy lol.</p>

<p><strong>Egwene.</strong> Oh this is so good! Rand comes in calm as can be. And proceeds to tell Egwene nearly everything she needs to know.</p>

<p>Rand speaks philosophically and Egwene worries that he is mad. She says she will have sisters examine him but he refuses. He tells her the last time he failed was because he used only men. It will take both saidin and saidar to seal the Bore. He says he remembers being Lews Therin like a dream.</p>

<p>He says he will go to Shayol Ghul in one month and break the remaining seals. He must clear the rubble, open the Bore fully, before it can be sealed again. He will meet them at the Field of Merrilor one day before. She thinks of her dream of him letting the sphere break. He asks leave to depart and turns to go. She sees his left hand is missing. After he is gone, the Sitters slump in their seats. Silviana, Barasine and Yukiri say could not speak for his ta'veren effect. Chubain reports that Bryne is following Rand to make sure he leaves. Egwene says they need allies to stop him from breaking the seals.</p>

<h2>Ch 4, The Pattern Groans, Pattern</h2>
<p><strong>Perrin.</strong> Hmm, Perrin riding Stayer is at the Jehannah Road with Faile, Wil, Seonid and the six Wise Ones, Nevarin. Berelain, Annoura Gallenne are also there. Alliandre stayed behind. A patch of the Blight has transplanted there. Mori examined the entire patch. They ride into the patch and find a strange village in the middle. Sulin reports that no one is there. Masuri says that the wood and thatch are something she has never seen. Perrin orders the Wise Ones to burn the whole area.</p>

<p>Oh wow, Perrin. I think I'm interested in your storyline now! Perrin wakes in the Wolf Dream! Perrin keeps fighting the urge to be his Young Bull wolf form. Perrin then sees visions - Mat fighting against himself, 12 different men wearing his face, a shadowy figure behind him comes with a bloody knife. - Sheeps running towards the woods chased by wolves, there is a terrible beaset in the woods and something is wrong with the wolves. - File, Grady, Elyas, and Gual followed by thousands walk toward a cliff. Whoa.</p>

<p>Perrin then chases a stag as Young Bull, bites it, then Hopper explains not to kill it here. And then Perrin agrees to let Hopper teach him his way... here we go!</p>

<p><strong>Galad.</strong> Oh heck, Dain Bornhald "he killed my father". Also, am I missing something, where is Morgase / Maighdin?? Is she not with Gill? </p>

<p>Galad is near the Jehannah Road... he has a message to send to the other Questioners about Asunawa - requesting they report to Galad. Also, Galad wants to ally with the Aes Sedai before the Last Battle - smart! Basel Gill is stopped by crew and they're seperating them all to see if their stories match up.</p>

<h2>Ch 5, Writings, Forsnaken</h2>
<p><strong>Gawyn.</strong> Dang it. I feel so simple-minded when I'm in Gawyn's head lol. He is going to do something very stupid... I feel it in my bones. Also, Mesaana is the assassin, I can't wait to find out who she has been masquarading as.</p>

<p>I'm interested in this plan for the AS bonding Warders. I think it's important - the Last Battle *is* coming..</p>

<p><strong>Egwene.</strong> Egwene, please don't turn people against Rand. The Seals are important to break, right? Also, why are you drinking mint tea Egwene?!</p>

<p><strong>Graendal.</strong> Whoa... Let's break this craziness down. Wow. I truly don't think Perrin will die. But who could her spies be?? Gotta be Dain Bornhold maybe, or Annoura?? oooo that'd be a twist!</p>

<p>Graendal is hiding on an island in the Aryth Ocean with only six of her pets, one a Tairen High Lady. A gateway takes her to Moridin's fortress. He is angry that Aran'gar is dead. Moridin says he will leave her without punishment and she wonders if that was a direct order from the DO or Shaidar Haran. he orders her to stay away from Rand, she says she will bring Perrin's head. She has spies and knows where his army is and she has planned a trap with her Shadowspawn army.</p>

<p>Moridin takes her to a storeroom with OP objects including three binders, a shocklance, a rema'kar, and a dreamspike - Moridin has two dreamspikes. Whatever the heck that means lol. A shocklance, we've heard that before TSR I think, Rand's Rhu visions. Moridin gives Graendal the dreamspike and warns her against using it against him.. and gives her the man with two souls.. SLAYER / LUC / ISAM! He tells her she will be greatly rewarded if she kills Perrin. He shows her a book of Dark Prophecies that says that Perrin will die. Moridin sends her back to the island, she can still touch the True Power a bit.</p>

<h2>Ch 6, Questioning Intentions, Blacksmith Puzzle</h2>
<p><strong>Morgase.</strong> Ask and I shall recieved.. Morgase! And so, we're sending a group to Cairhien, Edarra has suggested linking with the Asha'man to help with the gateways. The group to Cairhien includes.. Seonid, her Warder, two Maidens, Pel Aydaer, Cameaille Nolaisen, and Balwer lol, what a crew.</p>

<p>I love the interest Morgase has taken in serving drinks lol. Also, I certainly thought we were getting a marriage here! Tallanvor and Morgase sitting in a tree..</p>

<p>There have been a lot of chapters ending with.. "you've got to see this", "there's someone up the road", "and they knew just what to do..". Just an observation. Seems very middle trilogy book to me.</p>

<h2>Ch 7, Lighter than a Feather, Heron-Marked Sword</h2>
<p><strong>Lan.</strong> I'm not crying, you're crying... this is so good!!!</p>

<p>Lan and Bulen are riding, they have been for weeks - they're at the Plain of Lances near the border between Kandor and Saldaea. Lan bought Bulen a horse. Bulen suggests they go south, a much better raod - Lan declines. They ride past an inn, three men follow and they turn out to be peopel Lan used to command. Andere, Nazar, Rakim. Then two become five... for the Golden Crane!</p>

<p><strong>Galad.</strong> Oh boy, here we go - Byar is going to start on about how the Two Rivers is a place of Darkfriends.</p>

<p><strong>Perrin.</strong> Galad eats raisins.. Perrin eats HAM! See whos who here.</p>

<p><strong>Galad.</strong> Byar is a good storyteller it seems. His side of the story of course. </p>

<p><strong>Perrin.</strong> I do think Perrin will meet Galad. Let's fight, let's do this and let's kill Galad, or turn him to our side. Let's do it Goldeneyes.</p>

<h2>Ch 8, The Seven-Striped Lass, Dice</h2>
<p><strong>Mat.</strong> Ah, I struggled with that chapter lol. I was bored. Mat goes to taverns, dices, learns the gholam is in Caemlyn, Mat and Thom talk about the Tower of Genji, Elayne knows Mat is there but won't reply, Teslyn, Joline, and Edesina are going to return to the White Tower. Mat offers them horses. Mat lifts the tent flap and smells... blood.</p>

<h2>Ch 9, Blood in the Air, Wheel</h2>
<p><strong>Mat.</strong> Alright, this one was good.. "are you going to swear at her?" Mat, "of course I am, how is she going to know it's from me?!" haha.</p>

<p>The gholam killed Lopin, Riddem, and Will Reeve, and Gorderan and Fergin. Olver is fine. Mat wants to kill the gholam, they can't have it follow them to the Tower of Genji. They will leave as soon as his word to Verin is up. Mat needs to talk to Elayne and Aludra. Mat gives Joline horses to leave for the White Tower.</p>

<h2>Ch 10, After the Taint, Dragon's Fang</h2>
<p><strong>Perrin.</strong> Well that was fairly anticlimactic. Grady wants to see his wife and son, that sounds nice - too bad he's going to die before he gets to do that!lol I really don't know, just a prediction i'm throwing out.. Anyways, Perrin meets with Galad and demands his people back and Galad refuses unless they meet in battle. Perrin returns to his camp.</p>

<p><strong>Galad.</strong> Galad doesn't believe Byar's thoughts on Perrin, duh. But, Galad thinks Perrin is dangerous and wants to fight.</p>

<h2>Ch 11, An Unexpected Letter, Dragon</h2>
<p><strong>Elayne.</strong> Well boo, then yay, then eh lol. Elayne blah blah, Duhara (red) has been meetin gwtih Ellorien (Elaida's emissary)... then Mat writes a hilarious letter to Elayne - I look forward to them reconnecting. Mat asks for bellfounders. Elayne wants to take the Cairhien Sun Throne too, she will set up a meetin gwith Sumeko and Alise to discuss Traveling and the future of the Kin.</p>

<p>I look forward to seeing Mat and Elayne connect and Birgitte too. We have slowed this story way down it seems. Or maybe we're just in a school zone.. 25mph when I'd rather be going 45 - 50mph. Let's get a move on!</p>

<h2>Ch 12, An Empty Ink Bottle, Ornaments</h2>
<p>Maybe I'm just in a bad mood today for not getting much sleep, but YAWN. Alanna has disappeared with no trace of gateway, although not enough channeling for a gateway. Allana's belongings were gone leaving an empty ink bottle. There is an envelope sealed with red wax. Cadsuane thinks darkfriends could use Alanna to find Rand. Rand has been gone for three days. Bera brings some tea to Cadsuane and the tea tastes good... oh because Rand is happy not does that mean things are going to be better? With what he did with the Choedan Kal? That's neat! Ran has returned..</p>


<h2>Ch 13, For What Has Been Wrought, Aiel</h2>
<p><strong>Min.</strong> My heartstrings, they can't be tugged anymore! I WOULD LIKE TWO BOXES OF TISSUES PLEASE?? SO GOOD.</p>

<p>Rand is back, Min has viewings, an open cavern, gaping like a mouth - Shayol Ghul! Bloodstained rocks, two men dead on the ground surrounded by ranks of Trollocs, a pipe with smoke curling from it.. hopefully not Mat and Perrin.</p>

<p>Rand knows Alanna is gone, she might be in Arafel. He tells the Aiel he has toh and Rand requests Maiden guards at all times. Cadsuane is un-banished. Darlin is to assemble his forces. Rand promises to send help to Lan. Bashere, Min, Rand, and Nynaeve are to go to Arad Doman - Rand asks Min to keep working on understanding Callandor. Rand says he is not a weapon and never has been.. hmm. He asks Cadsuane for help finding someone in the Caralain Grass.. Perrin?</p>

<p>Weiramon and Anaiyella are darkfriends... hmmmm. Rand tells them to tell their associates that he is no longer blind.</p>

<p>Rand hugs Tam and cries and introduces Min as "someone very special to me".... AHHH I LOVE IT! </p>

<h2>Ch 14, A Vow, TAR</h2>
<p><strong>Egwene.</strong> Neat. Egwene meets with Nynave and Elayne and talk about life.. updates, yknow Black Ajah, Elayne being pregnant, Oath Rods, and Rand. Then BOOM TALVA AND ALVIARIN ARE THERE TRYING TO KILL EGWENE, but Alivarin ends up killing Talva instead. Egwene vows to find Mesaana. Also Egwene needs to use her skill of the Dream World more than channeling. Also, also, Egwene has requested Elayne and Nynaeve come tomorrow to swear on the Oath Rod. Also, also, also, they have to be Tested again. Neat.</p>

<h2>Ch 15, Use a Pebble, Pattern</h2>
<p><strong>Nynaeve.</strong> Well that was incredible. Nynaeve Healed the madness?! What?! THAT IS FREAKING AWESOME! Of course RJ / BS have an explanation for what the taint is doing to the mind.. thorn-like projections in the mind.. wow. Then Rands.. whoa, enormous black network with thousands of thorns, but there is a white lacing coating on the network - that is either the True Power or.. well, I really don't think I have an answer right now. Gotta be something to do with saidin and the cleansing and Rand destroying the Choedan Kal, hmm. I don't have an answer yet. Nynaeve will also Heal Narishma and Flinn - awesome. Also, Rand needs Nynaeve + another woman to help use Callandor.. who could it be?! Moiraine?? No, maybe! Maybe that grandmother.. who's name is completely escaping me (probs not her - but she was more powerful than Nynaeve right??).</p>

<p>Nynaeve Delves Naeff and finds a network of black veins with thorn-like projections in his mind. She pulls the thorns free and Heals the wounds. When the last one comes free the network shakes then vanishes. Naeff is now sane and no longer sees Fades following him. He rushes off to tell Nelavaire Demasiellin the good news.</p>

<p>undulating cout: 3.</p>

<p><strong>Egwene.</strong> Hmm. Who could Mesanna be?! This was neat, some more AOL things, I love that. </p>

<p>The clouds have returned to Tar Valon. Tea tastes stale and grain is spoiling. Egwene stands on the flat roof of the White Tower with Saerin, Yukiri and Seaine. She set them searching for information on Mesaana and defeating the Oath Rod. She quotes an ancient Brown scholar Yasicca Cellaech. Seaine has three theories on how to defeat the Oath Rod. Mesaana may have another Oath Rod that she can somehow use to negate the Oaths with an inverted weave of Spirit. She could have used Compulsion and the Mirror of Mists to have another sister swear in her place. Finally, she could have used a weave to alter her words so that what she actually swore to and what others heard are different. She orders them to keep working on it. Saerin reports that little is known about Mesaana herself. Marsim of Manetheren wrote about her. Alrom wrote about her schools. She was rejected as a researcher. Elandria Borndat wrote that she was more a direct leader than Graendal or Moghedien, sort of a Shadow Amyrlin. Lannis wrote that she was second only to Demandred in anger. She was angry at herself, the other Forsaken, the world that she was not the most important. She was an administrator who hated that position. She tried to deliver a broken White Tower and failed. She probably was part of Rand's kidnapping which also failed. Maybe also the women sent to the Black Tower which failed. Mesaana must need a great victory to regain her standing. Something like killing Egwene. Gawyn was mortified that she might use herself as bait, but she will have to do something to draw out Mesaana.</p>

<h2>Ch 16, Shanna'har, Puzzle</h2>
<p>I am bored. lol. Come on now, I am struggling with some of these chapters. There is A LOT of weak callbacks to the early books to touch on nostalgia and it feel shoehorned in. Maybe I'm just in a bad mood - idk. But Perrin is STILL TALKING ABOUT HOW HE IS NOT A LEADER. It's Whitecloaks this, wolves that, my wife this. boring. Perrin and Faile enjoy their anniversary, the shanna'har. Perrin tells Faile about the his wolf-side. Faile tells him about her captivity.</p>

<h2>Ch 17, Partings, and a Meeting, Lion</h2>
<p><strong>Mat.</strong> And the goodbyes are occuring, will we see any of these people again? Probably. Teslyn, Joline, and Edesina (to Tar Valon) with Juilin, Thera, Bayle Domon, and Egeaning too. They are sent with a message to the Amyrlin that Mat will come claim what is his.. he can't be talking about his Dagger can he?? no, he couldn't possibly! And Setalle is going to watch over Olver.. I don't doubt Olver will want to tag along, so we'll see if he stays with her.</p>

<p>I'm hoping this means Mat, Thom, and Noal are on their way to the Tower of Genji.. I'm not to assume we won't hear from Mat the rest of the book right RJ/BS?? RIGHT??! YOU WOULDN'T DO THAT TO US AFTER TAKING MOIRAINE AWAY FOR 8 BOOKS NOW... WOULD YOU? YOU WOULDN'T MAKE US WAIT MUCH LONGER... WOULD YOU?????</p>

<p><strong>Elayne.</strong> Alright Elayne, I agree with whoever said this before.. might've been Leon, but I think Elayne would've been a great Gray Ajah! Wow! What great negotiations skills ya sack of mashed potatoes.. whoa that was harsh lol. How about, great negotiation skills Elayne! I appreciate the fact that she thinks she is enormous lol. My wife being pregnant as well right now is making this fun.</p>

<p>Also, Elayne, come on... you can't put yourself in danger because Min said your babies would be born healthy, that doesn't mean anything for you - you could be captured by the Seanchan or even a Forsaken... you've been captured multiple times before!</p>

<p>Also, the Kin are looking to stay in Caemlyn and agree to provide Traveling and Healing.</p>

<h2>Ch 18, The Strength of This Place, Wolf</h2>
<p><strong>Perrin.</strong> I still really don't know fully what the wolf dream is, and obviously neither does Perrin. But this is good! This is good progress Perrin! Perrin is in the wolf dream, inspecting the WC camp, sees a signet ring with a winged dagger on it in Galad's tent. Hopper appears and Perrin can sense Oak Dancer, Sparks, and Boundless as well. Hopper teaching Young Bull how to use the wolf dream... finally! The strength of this place is his strength. They continue training and Hopper and Perrin stop when they find a translucent violet wall, Hopper says it is wrongness and the wall then vanishes. They continue training but Perrin is troubled. What the heck was that?!</p>

<p><strong>Ituralde.</strong> Am I very wrong in assuming that raken and Draghkar are similar?? Anyways, Ituralde and crew are protecting Mardon from Tollocs and Myddraal they've been fighting for week. Whoa! This was bloody. The Saldaeans will not help and will not let him into Maradon, treating his force as a foreign army. Bodies suddenly fall from the sky. The Shadowspawn have set up trebuchets and are launching dead Trollocs into their camp. Captain Finsas reports them moving more into place. Rajabi is taking command of part of the camp. Ituralde hopes that Rand keeps his promises. Another young officer is Zhell. Ituralde orders Lieutenant Nils to get a damage assessment and to tell Captain Creedin to guard the ford. Then suddenly there are live Draghkar among the falling bodies and they attack. One kills Rajabi. The Asha'man begin striking them down with balls of fire. Again Ituralde hopes that Rand will keep his promise to send help.</p>

<p><strong>Faile.</strong> I can safely say, this Berelain - Faile - Perrin mix has been my least favorite plotlines in the entire series. bar-none. I am so ready for Berelain to die or Faile to die or something to stop this childish nonsense. Isn't Faile like 16/18 and Berelain is older lol not really sure how old she is. Anyway, Berelain and Faile are planning to pretend to be friends. Not after Faile threatened to kill her in knife combat.. like they tried in TSR. Wow, die someone please. Although if Faile died soon, ohhhh I'd be pissed to, because we had what felt like 10 books at chasing Faile from the Shaido.. oh no, we are in a pickle now y'all. Who should die..</p>

<h2>Ch 19, Talk of Dragons, Dice</h2>
<p><strong>Mat.</strong> This was a perfect chapter. I love the way Mat, Elayne, Birgitte, and Thom interacted. Oh this was so good. Mat stumbling over his words as Elayne is showing confidence in being Queen, and Thom being proud of Elayne. OH so good I could cry. We have seen these kids grow up before our eyes! I mean, it's been a couple of years, but wow. I love this so mso much. Mat giving up the medalion for three days, I think we might be safe. I think. Thom as Royal Court Bard.. yes! Mat getting a title.. yes! I also love Mat and Thom together, father and son, it's so good.</p>

<p>They finally agree on a contact for the Band, the band gets one out of four dragons if they leave, and Mat lets Elayne have the foxhead medallion to study for three days. He feels naked without it with the gholam still around. He warns her about it. He is shocked again that she thinks she can copy it. She plans to Travel to Cairhien soon and Mat immediately realizes that that means the Sun Throne. She invites them to dinner. Talmanes and Dyelin will come as well. She also offers Thom a commission as official court bard. The commission includes a pardon for all crimes that he may have committed in Andor or Cairhien. Elayne has an appointment with her midwife before dinner.</p>

<p>what a line.. Mat, "I didn't do half of what they say, and the other half wasn't my bloody fault".. hahah</p>

<h2>Ch 20, A Choice, Star</h2>
<p><strong>Nynaeve.</strong> NYNAEVE'S BRAID! Oh noooo, what is she going to tug now. But holy smokes that was crazy! Did we really think Nynaeve wouldn’t attain her shawl?? Wow. Beautiful. Awesome. WHY IS BALEFIRE SO FROWNED UPON? Yes, the Pattern literally unravels a bit when used lol and a lot can go wrong, but the Last Battle is imminent y’all, let’s use it! Let’s learn it! Maybe I’ll change my name from sponge to (the last battle is imminent) lol. But whoa she did it. She has been raised AND she got Lan’s bond passed to her! Dang what a chapter!</p>

<p>SO GOOD: The Sitters finish their discussion. Saerin asks her to swear never to use balefire again but she refuses. She tells them that if she has to use it at Shayol Ghul with Rand then she will. Egwene warns them that refusing to raise the woman who helped cleanse the taint, who defeated Moghedien, the wife of the King of Malkier, would look very bad. Rubinde Acedone, Barasine and Lelaine vote no, but Yukiri, Seaine, Romanda and Saerin vote yes. Nynaeve passes the test, barely. They send her to her quarters for a night of contemplation before the ceremony the next morning but she has one thing to do first.</p>

<p>Nynaeve Travels to the Aes Sedai camp outside the Black Tower. They are still being made to wait for some reason. Nynaeve asks directions then goes to Myrelle's tent. She is there with one of her Warder, a big man with an Illianer-style beard. She tells Nynaeve to come back tomorrow but Nynaeve threatens her to get it done now. Myrelle weaves Spirit and Nynaeve can feel Lan in her mind. He is still alive. - this was actually pretty scary for me, because I AM SO SCARED OF THE BLACK TOWER! There have got to be so many darkfriends around.....</p>

<p>Also, undulate count: 4</p>

<h2>Ch 21, An Open Gate, Trollocs</h2>
<p><strong>Perrin.</strong> Apparently WE ARE GOING TO KILL SOME WHITECLOAKS.. LET'S GO! But Perrin is right, these people could help fight the DO at the LB. So, this is interesting.. If there is an alliance with the Seanchan it will end when the Car'a'carn is done and there will be blood feud.</p>

<p>Also, Perrin's picture has been passed around. Also, also, Perrin wants to go to Andor to talk with Elayne - I don't see that as much as a happy reuinion as Mat's.</p>

<p>Can someone help me with a timeline here? This Perrin stuff is like weeks / months prior to Rand telling Tam about Min right? Because how can Tam be in two places, or even be brought to Rand without anyone noticing.. "Perrin realized he wasn't getting any more tea".. hahahaha</p>

<p><strong>Ituralde.</strong> AWE-SOME STUFF. I love the way these battles are being written. I LOVE IT. I'm having so much fun reading. Trollocs are overwhelming Ituralde's army and pushing it back to Maradon, Ituralde gets his leg broken and then the gates of Maradon open and horsemen ride out to the rescue! The Saldaean commander is Yoeli, he tells Ituralde that this rescue will probably cost him his life.</p>

<p>I like that.. "Minds' for wolf-headed Trollocs, "Horns" for goats, "Beaks" for hawks, "Arms" for bears. The Minds were more intelligent, able to speak the human language to bargain with or trick their opponents - I have to check what type Narg was (tEOTW)!</p>

<p><strong>Morgase.</strong> Well this was beautiful. Morgase is stunned by the revelation about Gaebril. Taringail had tried to use her. Valda as well. Tallanvor finds her to say he is going to Tear. Thom and Gareth Bryne loved her, but not like Tallanvor. She tells him about Rahvin. She asks him not to leave yet and he agrees.</p>

<p>I think I should've kept track of "tempest" as well, as some of you may know the Stormlight Archive and the tempests there.. lol</p>

<h2>Ch 22, The End of a Legend, Dice</h2>
<p><strong>Gawyn.</strong> That was hilarious. Gawyn opens the door and an explosion of light and sound and he is wrapped in Air.. Egwene is awake, dressed, and very displeased... hahahah. Prior to that, Gawyn and some Younglings talked and some of them don't want to be Warder - they might be able to be Tower Guards, thanks to Gawyn. Then Gawyn asked advice from Bryne - nothing there but telling Gawyn to back off Egwene. Also, Bryne has maps and such around his room preparing for Trolloc attacks, there is a village near Dragonmount circled, also the Field of Merrilor is marked on the maps near the border of Shienar. Gawyn also chases an assassin but the person vanishes, gray-man? or Fain?! probably not Fain.</p>

<p>Also.. Boar Rushes Down the Mountain!</p>

<p><strong>Mat.</strong> Mat is awesome. Thom is awesome, heck even Noal is awesome. Love this conversation about the Tower of Ghenjei (wow I've been spelling that wrong...) lol. Thom thinks a deal can be made with the A&E to trade for Moiraine. Also, Mat kills some cutpurses and then another who recognized Mat. Mat thinks Birgitte will know more about the A&E!</p>

<p>Noal joins him and says Mat will soon be more famous than Jain Farstrider. Thom comes in disguised as a Murandian. They have not learned anything useful about the Tower of Ghenjei. Thom says the Aelfinn and Eelfinn made a deal with the Aes Sedai. If he can learn what they did, maybe he can trade it for Moiraine. They will take lanterns, torches and fireworks from Aludra. Thom has some hand drums and cymbals along with his flute and harp. Noal has some iron swords and knives and a band of iron for Mat's ashandarei.</p>

<p><strong>Birgitte.</strong> Holy smokes - that was a lot. Elayne is enjoying a play, hopefully someone doesn't hurt her while she's enjoying the play.. Birgitte has led many lives but never been a Warder before, she is sad she can't remember much of Gaidal. Mat meets with Birgitte after being taken by her guards and they go to The Grand Hike inn and the inkeeper is Snert. Mat asks about the Tower of Ghenjei and Birgitte warns him.</p>

<p>Aelfinn snakes, Eelfin foxes! Birgitte went there once as Jethari Moondancer, after the battle of Lahpoint Hills where she led the Buchaner rebellion, Gaidal was wounded and she took him there to be Healed. The Eeflinn killed them both after they were lost in the Tower for two months. They feed off emotion and they particularly like Aes Sedai. Birgitte tells Mat that he needs to get the the Grand Hall in the Tower. Iron to bind, fire to blind, music to dazzle.. I CAN'T WAIT!</p>

<h2>Ch 23, Foxheads, Darkfriend</h2>
<p><strong>Elayne.</strong> Well, whoa now. Mellar has escaped with the copy of the foxhead ter'angreal.</p>

<p>Elayne is at the play but she focuses on the foxhead medallion and the copy she made. It fails to work with more powerful weaves, plus she cannot channel when holding it. She can channel when holding the original.  Elayne recalls that Ispan seemed to be under some sort of Compulsion. Elayne suddenly has an idea how to get around that problem. Birgitte will not like it but she is not there.  Kaila Bent tells her that Birgitte is with Mat. In her rooms, she dons a black cloak and weaves Fire and Air for the Mirror of Mists to disguise herself as something creepy. She feels safe visiting the Black Ajah alone because of Min's viewing. She Travels to Chesmal's cell in the dungeons and pretends to be a Forsaken. Chesmal is taken in and tells her one of the two they seek, Mat, is in Caemlyn and they are planning an assassination. They are almost in position for the invasion of Andor.</p>

<p>Elayne no longer feels the Kin holding Chesmal's shield. The cell door opens and it is the secretary, Temaile and Eldrith. Eldrith sees through the sham. Elayne manages to shield Eldrith and Chesmal but the secretary attacks her breaking her shoulder. She knocks him away with Air but he gets the foxhead medallion from her.</p>

<p>Using all the One Power she can muster, she pulls the ceiling down on top of him. He ducks away and runs dropping one medallion. It is the original. Birgitte and Mat arrive and report that the guards and Kin outside are dead. They take Elayne to Melfane.</p>

<p><strong>Gawyn.</strong> This blade, with the three bits of blood-colored rock embedded, have we seen that beofre?? Anwyay, Egwene is mad at Gawyn for springing the trap, Gawyn then leaves to go to Elayne in Caemlyn - through the Traveling ground Egwene has setup.</p>

<p><strong>Lan.</strong> Yep, more of this please?! Lan is incensed when he sees Nazar tuck a golden crane banner into his saddlebag. They are in eastern Kandor near the border of Arafel. Bulen gets breakfast ready. Lan sees several new tents in the camp and eight men talking with Andere. Three appear Malkier and five Shienaran. Andere introduces the Malkier as Weilin Aldragoran, Managan and Gorenellin. The Shienarans are Qi, Joao, Merekel, Ianor and Kuehn. Andere met them earlier and sent them ahead to wait on this roadway. Rakim found them last night. The Malkier merchants sold all they could and brought two dozen wagons of supplies and a dozen warhorses. Lan agrees that they can come, but swears them to silence. They will pose as a caravan of merchants. The five have become dozens.</p>

<h2>Ch 24, To Make a Stand, Wolf</h2>
<p><strong>Elayne.</strong> Bed-rest, good. Birgitte reported that Mellar, Shiaine, Marillin, and Falion escaped and the secretary was murdered. Elayne gave mat his foxhead medallion back, and he wants to talk to Ealyne about the gholam.. hmm, what is he going to say about that?</p>

<p><strong>Ituralde.</strong> Rodel Ituralde is a good man, put that on his tombstone if he ever dies. Wow. Ituralde has been Healed by Asha'man Antail... Vram TOrkumen appointed lord of the city in Tenobia's absence is not a fan of Ituralde and Ituralde calls him out for it - names him a Darkfriend and hopes that he burns for the men he lost. Yoeli asks about the Asha'man and gateways, Ituralde knows this is about communications and supplies and neither Yoeli or Ituralde will use them to escape. Also  Yoeli's sister Sigril leads the Lastriders to the southeast who will ride with the news if Maradon falls. Queen Tenobia took many troops with her when she left to search for the Dragon Reborn. Yoeli and many others carry a black and yellow pendant called the Traitor's Banner. Ituralde thinks of an Old Tongue phrase, Desya gavane cierto cuendar isain carentin ("A resolute heart is worth ten arguments."). His rescue came only after fighting among the Saldaeans.</p>

<p><strong>Perrin.</strong> SLAYER! So this has got to be the World of Dreams, but I just can't fit all the pieces together. I'm excited to hopefully learn more. Also, Elyas doesn't go in the wolf dream.. hmm.</p>

<p>In the wolf dream, Perrin starts at his camp by the great sword impaling the ground. He calls for Hopper but gets no response. He searches the Whitecloak camp again but learns nothing new. Balwer did not recognize the Lord Captain Commander's signet. Perrin thinks he is an honorable man. He senses Oak Dancer's pack, Boundless, Sparks, Morninglight and others. They lead him on a chase to the Mountains of Mist but he cannot catch them. Hopper appears and tells him he is in the dream too strongly, to remember Faile. He practices moving to where the wolves are and finally gets it right. The wolves laugh and he feels like he did when cousin Wil dropped a bucket of wet feathers on him. He practices following and changing his surroundings. He moves again and he is on the side of Dragonmount. The next move takes him back to the Jehannah Road. There is a howl of pain and Morninglight dies, killed by Slayer. Perrin goes there and attacks the man who looks like Lan. Slayer is much stronger, more proficient in the wolf dream and Perrin barely escapes alive. Hopper is angry that a foolish cub attacked a lion. Perrin says he must learn to face Slayer. The Last Hunt is upon them.</p>

<p>Elyas approaches. Elyas chose to leave his life for the wolves. Perrin does not want to and Noam had to. Elyas only has a scent of worry. He says he stays away from the wolf dream. Perrin tells him to alert Tam and the others. They will meet the Whitecloaks tomorrow. He wonders about his vision of wolves running sheep toward a beast and wonders if it is the Whitecloaks.</p>

<h2>Ch 25, Return to Bandar Eban, Sea Folk</h2>
<p><strong>Min.</strong> And now we have Jesus Rand lol. Wow, it's so hard to unsee now hahaha. Min has some viewings, and they are just great, this was such a nice happy chapter lol.</p>

<p>Dark clouds pushed away by the sunlight's warmth. Rand, a brilliant white sword held in his hand, wielded against one of black, held by a faceless darkness.Trees, growing healthy and full. An inn in the Two Rivers with the mark of the Dragon's Fang inlaid on the door, a sign of victory and hope, not darkness or hate. A silver axe, the man will be a leader in the Last Battle. A woman will be trained in the White Tower and become Aes Sedai. Another man will save her life.</p>

<p>Rand goes to the man Min saw as a leader, Durnham. He was in the King's Guard before the king disappeared and Lady Milisair Chadmar disbanded them. Rand names him Captain and tells him to gather others. He spots Votabek and Redbord. Rand orders Naeff to bring weapons, armor and uniforms from the Stone. The men agree that Lain will not pay them so they will work for Durnham. In an hour Rand has five hundred soldiers and they have uniforms and armor. Rand then orders Naeff to bring Aes Sedai for Healing the sick. They go to the docks next. The harbor is full of Sea Folk vessels. Iralin still runs the docks. Lady Milisair Chadmar fled an hour after Rand left and the other Council of Merchants members within a day. They go to one of the ships, the Whitecap to speak to the Sailmistress Milis din Shalada Three Stars. There are spills sacks of spoiled grain on the deck. Rand opens a new sack and the grain is fine. Rand names Iralin to the Council of Merchants and orders him to distribute the food. He then names Iralin Steward of the city and Durnham his Captain. Rand says he will spend a day there to get things stable before he leaves.</p>

<h2>Ch 26, Parley, Whitecloak</h2>
<p><strong>Perrin.</strong> I think we're going to get a parley folks. Why would the Asha'man gateways not work?? Perrin sends off some warning booms and such, and requests to speak to Galad, Perrin doesn't want to fight until he understands what all is goin on. The air smells wrong, Slayer is around, and I'm just here to see Galad.. or Dain Bornhold dead! BRING ME HIS HEAD! Also, Perrin is using the Hammer now. </p>

<p><strong>Galad.</strong> Morgase has finally revealed herself, thank you Galad. And we are going to get a mother-freaking Whitecloak Darkfriend trail against Perrin judged by the very own Morgase Trakand! WOO! What a twist! I'm excited. I love Galad here... "Perrin must not have ever been to a formal parley before" after serving tea.. hahahaha. Let's goooooooo! Also, Galad is shook by Berelain lol. </p>

<h2>Ch 27, A Call to Stand, Flame</h2>
<p><strong>Egwene.</strong> Nice - Egwene has power over the monarchs of the world (including Rand), and the Hall has power over the army. No more Hall meetings in secret.</p>

<p>She moves to add to Tower Law that all Sitters must be in the Tower or appoint surrogates, all Sitters and the Amyrlin must be notified of all meetings of the Hall. The Sitters stand for the Greater Consensus. Egwene and Silviana return to her study and Egwene sends Nissa and Nicola to Caemlyn to get new dream ter'angreal from Elayne. Egwene will train them and others but only some. Rosil will not let her put them in danger. Silviana tells her that Gawyn is in Caemlyn. She orders a message sent for him to return. Even though he is infuriating she will need him.</p>

<h2>Ch 28, Oddities, Trollocs</h2>
<p><strong>Faile.</strong> Faile is angry that Morgase didn't tell her who she was. Faile also thinks she can use the way Berelain looked at Galad to her advantage. Perrin goes to sleep - literally just like me. I could sleep anywhere and I fall asleep so quickly lol.</p>

<p><strong>Perrin.</strong> Ahhh the Tower of Ghenjei! Hopper tells Perrin to stay away from the Tower, that's where Perrin woke up in the Wolf Dream. The colors don't swirl in the wolf dream. ... I AM PUMPED TO GET MORE WOLF DREAM! </p>

<p>Hopper vanishes and Perrin now easily follows. They are on the Jehannah Road and the violet dome is there. Oak Dancer, Sparks and Boundless are trapped inside with Slayer. Perrin tries to pass through but it knocks him down. Hopper is stronger and makes it through. Perrin runs through it, collapsing but quickly recovering. Sparks is wounded. Hopper goes to distract Slayer while Perrin rescues Sparks. He finds the wolf, returns to the edge of the dome and jumps through. Slayer appears just inside the dome with a drawn arrow and Perrin shifts to Dragonmount. The wolves there greet him. Slayer does not follow. Hopper sends that Whisperer is dead. Perrin and Hopper will practice every night until he is strong enough to face Slayer.</p>

<p><strong>Ituralde.</strong> Oh, so it's called The Great Serpent.. that's awesome! I love that actually. And oh shoot... DREADLORDS - also a cool name, thanks RJ. Oh yes, Ituralde is climbing up my list of favorite characters, looks like I'll need a main character, secondary, and tertiary character list!</p>

<p>Rodel freaking Ituralde man, whoa! This is an incredible group of soliders commanded by an incredible Great Captain, wow.</p>

<p>A boy brings word that Captain Yoeli needs him on the wall. Ituralde finds him with full Asha'man Deepe Bhadar. There are thousands of Trollocs camped around the city. Deepe reports that he can feel at least six men channeling down there, something powerful. then... boom Ituralde is on the ground, right eye severely damanged there is a holl in the wall, Deepe is maimed and missing a leg. Connel, a guard, brings Ituralde to a sick tent where Antail weaves something that gives Ituralde strength, but later he will be VERY EXHAUSTED. Then Heals Deepe. They then use Cordamora Palace as headquaters, the city is in chaos and Trollocs are crossing the moat and Ituralde plans retreat, but Yoeli pleads him to stay - apparenlty Yoeli's sister is coming.</p>

<p>Ituralde sends Tymoth, second in command after Deepe, and the other Asha'man except for Antail to defend the hole in the wall. They defend for nearly an hour. The Dreadlords do not participate.  The Asha'man abandon the wall and the Trollocs enter the city down the main avenue. It is a carefully laid trap. Arrows rain down on the Trollocs and the remaining Saldaean cavalry tramples them. The remaining Trollocs flee and Ituralde plans another trap.</p>

<h2>Ch 29, A Terrible Feeling, Wheel</h2>
<p><strong>Faile.</strong> Ah dang, Berelain is still alive lol. This has taken quite the turn for me hahaha, maybe I don't really want Berelain dead, but it would be interested, right? lol. Anyways, the trial of Perrin is two days away and BOOM bubble of evil that takes every weapon in the camp and starts to attack you - dirt stops the weapons.</p>

<p><strong>Morgase.</strong> Oh this is good. Morgase, is a smart woman. Also, I love Perrin. I know he's boring and his storyline has been dragged and dragged and dragged but he is the most honest character we have - I think. I don't know, i'm just finding Perrin be the same Perrin as he has been since we met him. He's a good man. Also, Galad is stuck on this black/white - everything is black and white. Morgase, I think she talked some sense into him! Also also, Perrin has requested an extension on the trial date - to tend his wounded.</p>

<p><strong>Perrin.</strong> Healing will take days - Galad will "think" on delaying the trail. Perrin wonders why his hammer didn't come alive.. I have a theory! Tam says Rand needs him, and Tam promises to be at the Last Battle - we're close to matched up timelines now, and Tam heads off, the Aes Sedai need him. </p>

<p>Bubble of Evil Theory: could it be, something or someone in the World of Dreams "in the flesh" that are picking up things or changing things.. oh now that I start this - I need to think more. I assumed it had something to do with Slayer in TAR messing but there would need to be a lot of people in TAR in the flesh, doing things. so maybe my theory has no legs...</p>

<p><strong>Elayne.</strong> Ahh, we are gearing up for a brutal Last Battle. Birgitte has a feeling that something terrible has begun with the creation of these cannons (dragons).</p>

<p>Complying with Melfane's order, Elayne has a makeshift bed carried atop the city wall near the road to Aringill to see the dragons. News from Cairhien is that all the noble Houses claim to be eagerly awaiting her, Daes Dae'mar fully in effect. She has to find a way to take the Sun Throne without getting into their politics. On the tower Aludra waits with a model dragon. Mat explained that all she wants is vengeance on the Seanchan. Elayne remembers her from Luca's circus. She intends to have Norry keep an eye on her. She heard the first tests last night. Birgitte waits with her while the test is set up. Dummies are set up on a far hill. She has another copy of the foxhead medallion with her. The test proceeds and the dragon goes off with a thunderous roar. The first shot misses but the second destroys most of the dummies. Elayne and Birgitte are amazed at the potential and Elayne offers Aludra the resources of Andor. Birgitte has a feeling that something terrible has begun.</p>

<h2>Ch 30, Men Dream Here, Wolf</h2>
<p><strong>Faile.</strong> Sneaky Faile. I get it, she loves Perrin, but this isn't what he wants! </p>

<p><strong>Perrin.</strong> Oh yeah, Perrin is awesome... or maybe it's Young Bull that's awesome??? OH OH! Anyways, Perrin is learning more about the wolf dream - hey me too buddy. Then they go to Caemlyn to find the nightmares of men.. Perrin falls into a woman's nightmare about Rand (the dragon reborn).</p>

<p>Then Perrin wants to find another but Hopper says the moment is here. The Last Hunt begins or does not. The decision will be made. They go to Dragonmount and there is a huge storm and lots of wolves. Perrin is drawn to the clouds above. Hopper cannot follow any higher. When he is a dozen feet from the top Perrin sees a faint reflection of Rand in the real world. Tendrils of black wrap around him. Suddenly, a sliver of light comes out and the web of black begins to crack. Then it explodes in brilliant light and the storm vanishes. Rand stands in the middle of the light and the wolves howl in victory. The Last Hunt has come.</p>

<p><em>undulate count: 5.. 6 (two in this chapter, like 2 paragraphs apart lol)</em></p>

<h2>Ch 31, Into the Void, Dice</h2>
<p><strong>Mat.</strong> Let me just say this.. this feels like this was completely written by Brandon Sanderson. Not just the inn, The Dusty Wheel, and Hatch the inkeeper - and maybe that clouded my judgement, but this was an incredibly exciting action sceen that was quick and to the point and led to a great finish. Just my thoughts..</p>

<p>The gholam is.. dead? Mat fought the gholam with his ashandari with a medallion attached and two copies in his pocket - they had an expertly laid out plan to "kill" it. Mat kicked it into a gateway, into the void! Mat plans to give the extra medallions to Olver and Tuon. Mat and Talmanes claim combat pay from the Crown for ridding the city of the gholam. Honestly, I didn't think this was going to happen - I thought Talmanes was going to die going into the burning building and Mat was going to kill the gholam with the medallions - I'm happy how this turned out!</p>

<p>THE DUSTY WHEEL! Holy smokes,the rumor wheel, best place in caemlyn to listen to rumors: most of them were untrue , but that was half the fun! And Hatch the inkeeper... aw Matt Hatch from The Dusty Wheel has a cameo! </p>
