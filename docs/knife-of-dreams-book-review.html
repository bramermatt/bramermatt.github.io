<h2>Header</h2>
<p>"The sweetness of victory and the bitterness of defeat are alike a knife of dreams. —from Fog and Steel by Madoc Comadrin</p>

<h2>Prologue, Embers Falling on Dry Grass, Wheel and Snake</h2>
<p><strong>Galad.</strong> OH DANG! Galad is Lord Captain Commander of the White Cloaks and has gained a heron marked blade for killing Eamon Valda in Children of the Light challenge!! BOOM WHAT A START! </p>

<p>Galad is riding along a road in Amadicia with Trom, Dain Bornhald, and Jaret Byar. The Whitecloaks are now allied with the SC. They are heading to a manor house once belonging to Ailron that the SC gave to Eamon Valda. Galad plans to kill Valda. Bornhald an dByar told him that Valda assulted and killed Morgase. Trom and Galad have both been promoted to Lord Captain because three of the high officers were killed by ht eSC at Jeramel. At the manor there are 50 regular WC and half a dozen Questioners led by Rhadam Asunawa. Valda is angry with Trom because he is supposed to be headed to Nassad with other Lords Captain to meet with the SC. </p>

<p>Galad challenges Valda and Asunawa objects and wants to arrest Galad - Valda accepts. Galad studied under Henre Haslin and Gareth Bryne. Galad kills Valda after an awesome battle. Most of the WC claps, Asunawa and the Questioners are gone. They rode toward Nassad. Galad's supporters believe Asunawa has gone to talk the other Lords Captain into arresting him. Galad wants to seek other allies to oppose the SC. A Cairhienin named Doirellin and the others agree. Galad tells them they might have to ally with the AS and the Asha'man if they want to fight at The Last Battle. The men agree. Whitecloak law says it is allowable to ally with the serpent to fight the raven and Galad is now the new Lord Captain Commander.</p>

<p><strong>Ituralde.</strong> Sneaky plans Ituralde.. and I know none of them lol. </p>

<p>Rodel Ituralde leads 100 Domani and three hundred Tarabon. Tornay Lanasiet leads 200 Tarabon. They are near the village of Serana in Tarabon halfway between Elmora and Amadicia. There is a SC camp nearby. They ride into view of the camp surprising the SC and Tarabon there. The defenders mount a charge and seem to trample a few people in the field.. ghosts?? Lanasiet's men charge forward but Ituralde has his archers take out the SC command along with a sul'dam and damane. When the SC and Tarabon survivors flee, Lanasiet and his men chase. Jaalam rides up - there are no bodies on the field where the people were standing. Ituralde orders him to burn the warehouse. He has 20,000 men all over Tarabon on similar raids. He means to work his way north and re-gather his men, and he expects the SC to follow. They will fall into the trap he has set in Almoth Plain, if they see the trap he has a backup plan.</p> 

<p><strong>Suroth.</strong> Holy crap! Well so much for meeting the Empress lol. I have been wanting to meet the Empress for some books now, and now I guess I have already met her lololol. So Semirhage is using the Balzamon trick huh lol - that's awesome, I'm glad that's back! Suroth.. I am EXCITED TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS! The entire Imperial family, including the Empress Radhanan are dead, Seandar is in chaos and there is war from Aldael Mountains to Salaking.. "let the Lord of Chaos rule". Also Liandrin is here and is going to be collared! WOO! wait.. morally ambiguous lol. </p>

<p>Dawn is nearing in Ebou Dar and High Lady Suroth still cannot sleep. She wonders if Tuon is alive or dead. It has been seventeen days. She thinks the escape of the Atha'an Miere damane and death of Tylin mean Tuon is dead. Someone is trying to disrupt the Return. Two of her own sul'dam, Renna and Seta, disappeared at the same time. Egeanin Tamarath stole a pair of damane and also disappeared. If Tuon is, indeed, dead Suroth will have to apologize to the Empress. If that happens she will kill herself before reaching Seandar. She still has some hope. Tuon's der'sul'dam left nine days ago with all her sul'dam and damane. Captain Musenge left at the same time with many of his men. She worries that someone may suspect she is Atha'an Shadar, a Darkfriend.</p>

<p>The door opens and Liandrin enters dressed as da'covale. Almandaragal, her lopar, prepares to defend her. Liandrin professes her loyalty citing how she killed Alwhin. She brings a message from an officer of Captain-General Galgan to summon Suroth. Suroth thinks it is time to have a sul'dam collar Liandrin; she will send Elbar to find another Darkfriend.</p>

<p>She sends Liandrin to Rosala for a beating then goes to her anteroom where Banner-General Mikhel Najirah awaits. She has a screen decorated with a kori, a huge spotted cat from the Sen T'jore. He escorts her through the palace where Beslan is now king. Captain-General Lunal Galgan's ancestors date back to Luthair Paendrag Mondwin. He tells her that raken began arriving three hours ago with reports from Lieutenant-General Turan of dozens of raids in Tarabon. Rodel Ituralde was behind them. She orders them to bring her Ituralde's head. She orders Captain of the Air Yulan to put most of his raken on the hunt. He wants to save some for Banner-General Khirgan and to search for the Aiel and seven thousand deserter Whitecloaks in Amadicia. Galgan does not object as long as he has the to'raken he needs for Altara and Illian.</p>

<p>She returns to her rooms where Semirhage appears masked in fire. Semirhage offers to make her Empress. Suroth is terrified, but Semirhage tells her that Empress Radhanan and all the imperial family is dead. Seandar is in chaos and there is war from the Aldael Mountains to Salaking. She laughs and says, "Let the Lord of Chaos rule." Suroth is horrified that even one of the Da'concion, the Chosen Ones, could do that. Semirhage orders her to put all her efforts to killing Tuon and to expanding the rumor that she is an impostor. Suroth agrees. She will send Elbar with thousands of men.</p>

<p><strong>Pevara.</strong> Oh yes, Black Ajah plots! Pevara is ready to bond an Asha'man! I was pumped about this Supreme Council meeting that this crew is about to disrupt.. wow! Pevara wants to bring Zerah and the others to attack the meeting, BUT Yukiri convinces her it is a bad idea. They know now that Elaida's mission was to find treason in Alviarin, not hunt the BA.. lol. Also these Reds know that Damar Flinn has Healed the stilling! WOO! </p>

<p><strong>Alviarin.</strong> Alviarin retrieves a secret message and returns to her quarters. She is still overwhelmed by her experience with Shaidar Haran, the Great Lord in her eyes. The whole White Ajah is ashamed of her for being demoted from Keeper. She is still sore from her penances with Silviana. Katerine spread the news of Dumai's Wells through the Black Ajah. In her rooms she decodes the message and two others. One reports that Talene left the White Tower yesterday, before the Supreme Council meeting. Alviarin is now certain there was something between her and Yukiri and Doesine. Alviarin is afraid to call Mesaana who probably wants to kill her. She writes orders to find Talene and to keep close watch on Yukiri and Doesine.</p>

<p><strong>Galina.</strong> Can it be this book Faile is saved?? I am hopeful! Galina is gai'shain white now! She plans to get back at Elaida, Therava still owns her, and she can't channel without permission. She wants to get the Oath Rod to remove her obedience oaths.. then Gual and Neald pop in and remove her. She's brought back to Perrin's camp and talks with them going by the name Alyse. Perrin has Galina verify the accuracy of his maps of Malden and the surrounding Shaido camp. Perrin asks about what the Wise One's drink and if it's only water... they're going to poison the water-hole! I don't remember where that reference comes from lol. He asks her to warn Faile to go to Lady Cairen's fortress at the north end of the city and hide when she hears wolves during the day. Lying, Galina says she will. After retrieving her horse Neald takes her back to the Shaido camp. She is late and Therava punishes her. She plans to get the Oath Rod, kill Faile and her friends, and escape.</p>

<p><strong>Egwene.</strong> Oh yeah, I'm ready for this. But, really? We've stopped the progress or is everyone else going to start the siege now that Eg has been captured?? What are we going to do now?? </p>

<p>Eg is riding in a carriage through TV from Northarbor to the WT. 5 AS are with her Katerine, Barasine (REDS), Felaana (BROWN), Pritalle (YELLOW), Berisha (GRAY). They seem to be at each other's throats. Jala and Merym went ahead to report to Elaida. They forkrooted Eg. Eg tells them she converted the harbor chain to cuendillar.. wow! Nicola is there in novice white, Elaida wants Eg sent to Silviana. Nicola apologizes. Leane has been captured too, she converted half the chain there. Elaida has reduced Eg to novice, but otherwise nto punished her. Eg tells her she is a Dreamer and warns them of the coming SC attack. Eg is escorted back to the novice quaters and she enters TAR and she wants to warn Siuan and Eg is going to start working on the WT from within.</p>

<h2>Ch 1, When Last Sounds, TAR</h2>
<p><strong>Siuan.</strong> Oh this is very good! I’m excited now. See at the end of COT I didn’t really care that Eg was captured. I felt like it was just prolonging the plot from happening. Because, and this is my fault for thinking this, I thought the Salidar Aes Sedai would be storming the Tower and it would be a huge gigantic battle since there were a lot of soldiers and Aes Sedai and Novices. And now, I don’t know what is going to happen… Also, I absolutely love the wind starting from Dragonmount, what a powerful image. Feels like this is going to be a good book to me! Siuan’s ability to Heal is strong since Nynaeve Healded her.. interesting. Lelaine also wants to betray Egweene… yuck.</p>

<p>A wind rises at the peak of Dragonmount and carries a sulfurous smell east past the Salidar Aes Sedai camp and to the army camp where it wakes Siuan.  She lights a lantern with Fire. Bryne is still out and about. She is angry and confused about her feelings toward him. She sees that he blacked his own boots and angrily removes it with Earth, Fire and Air. Min told her she has to stay close to him. The sudden wind wrecked the camp and many people are injured. Her ability to Heal is strong since Nynaeve Healed her.</p>

<p>She borrows a horse, Nightlily, that belongs to Nemaris, a campfollower's wife. Nightlily is not as mild as Bela and she has a rough ride to the Salidar Aes Sedai camp. Arriving at the Salidar Aes Sedai camp she weaves Spirit to hide her ability to channel. She passes Sheriam's and Morvrin's dark tents and stops at Myrelle's. Three Warder, Arinvar, Avar Hachami, and Jori stand guard. She first weaves Air and a hint of Fire to eavesdrop but the tent is warded. She goes inside and finds Myrelle, Morvrin, Carlinya and Sheriam. Siuan reports the Egwene and Leane are alive and well and that they mostly succeeded. Beonin went to bed and they have ousted Nisao from their group. Sheriam wants to Travel to free them but Egwene ordered no rescue. They do not understand why Elaida did not order an immediate trial. Sheriam is still angry because Elaida abolished the Blue Ajah.</p>

<p>Lelaine Akashi enters. They tell her about Egwene and she asks Siuan to walk with her. Outside, Burin, Nuhel Dromand, Arinvar and Jori wait. Burin joins Lelaine. She tells Siuan that she uncovered Faolain's spying and kept her confined.  Siuan tells her that Egwene ordered a sitting of the Hall in the White Tower in Tel'aran'rhiod when Last sounds the next night. She keeps the betrayal a secret because someone in the Hall was the leak. Lelaine tells Siuan to support her for the Amyrlin against Romanda if Egwene dies or is stilled. Siuan worries that Lelaine now also has reason to betray Egwene. </p>

<h2>Ch 2, The Dark One’s Touch, Aes Sedai</h2>
<p><strong>Beonin.</strong> This is a neat perspective. Food is spoiling and Beonin thinks the Dark One is touching the world. She also thinks that Rand has much to answer for but the Dragon Reborn must win the LB. Beonin seized the moment when Elaida deposed Siuan and she has adjusted since then. The AS are all on edge because of the murders of Anaiya and Kaire.. duh lol. It’s Halima y’all. Both Anaiya and Kairen were Blues and had contact with Moraine and Rand… are we getting Moiraine this book???? Beonin suggests a connection with Asha’man. Beonin rides to the Traveling ground.. awesome! She weaves a gateway with Spirit to a grove near the WT, she loves weaving the gateway.. I agree it’s pretty awesome. When they arrive, she sees the ghost of Turanin Merdagon who died forty years ago when Beonin was Accepted. She weaves Illusion to disguise herself and sends her Warder Tervail to find and inn and she goes into the WT to find Elaida…. Why?</p>

<p><strong>Elaida.</strong> Mattin Stepaneos is not dead! Cool. He was kidnapped from Illian before Rand came and just arrived yesterday - Elaida has a plan to get him the crown back. Beonin comes in and tells Elaida about Egwene telling everyone she's alive and such. Then says she is good at the new Healing and then shows gateways for Traveling and Skimming. Elaida tells her not to tell anyone those weaves without her permission. Beonin tells her about the ten moles including Meidani and Elaida wants to have the moles watched and invite Meidani to dinner. Beonin can teach Tarna all the new weaves and Elaida orders Beonin to show her everything. Also the Wards are failing against rats lol. </p>

<p>Tarna enters and reports that Southharbor is only slightly functional. After the rebels are defeated Elaida intends to add their army to the Tower Guard. Gareth Bryne is a much better captain than High Captain Jimar Chubain. The streets of Tar Valon are filthy because workers are afraid of the ghosts. Elaida has studied writings on the Last Battle and the ghosts mean it is coming soon. She thinks she will soon have Elayne back in hand. There is news of Tarabon rebelling against the Seanchan. The Tar Valon sewers are clogged. There are rats in the White Tower; the Wards are failing. </p>

<h2>Traveling</h2>
<p>Okay I have a lot of thoughts. About the Ways and Traveling and Gateways and Skimming. This might sound a bit jumbled but here we go.. So, the Ways were created by male channelers right? or was it just the Aes Sedai at during the AOL? Anyways.. so my thought/prediction is the Ways / Waygates are a tied off wWeave / Standing weave / Keeping weave of a gaTraveling Gateway (not the instant jump from one place to another, but ) but a place that has bridges and walkways built up for walking... now with the Black Wind.. no idea on that lol. But that's my thought. Since non-channelers can use the Ways. Also, the use of the trefoil Avendesora leaf.. hmm. I don't know, but that is my thought and I'm excited to RAFO!</p>

<h2>Ch 3, At the Gardens, Forsnaken</h2>
<p><strong>Aran'gar.</strong> Holy smokes I haven't even read two pages and so many things have been revealed. WHOA! Alright. Aran'gar is Bathamel, because they talked about Aginor. And Moridin is Ishameael, at least Aran'gar has no doubt. I've been saying that since book seven! WOO! </p>

<p>So let’s go! The remaining Forsaken are in TAR, summoned by Moridin. Graendal, Demandred, Mesaana and Semirhage are there, there are 11 chairs. Asmo, Sammael, Be’lal, and Rahvin are dead, Osan’gar hasn’t been seen since SL (Winter’s Heart) - because he was killed by Elza! Zomara serve wine, Moridin / Ishamael found a stasis box with dozens of Zomaran. Aran’gar found two but they only heard rubbish, she is wearing an emerald necklace from Delana, Aran’gar is weak in TAR. She can only find Eg’s dream when she sleeps next to her. Graendal has a lot of Darkfriend contacts. Aran’gar propositions Graendal.. Mesaana is angry at Aran’gar because she lost Egwene and the rebellion will fall apart. Aran’gar tells her the rebellion is holding and Mesaana will wait until Elaida breaks Eg, Mesaana won’t tell where Eg is held. </p>

<p>Moridin comes in with Mogi and Cyndane (Lanfear!), Moridin is Nae’blis. Moridin says Sammael or someone disguised as him ordered 100 Fades and 1000s of Trollocs into the Ways. It must have been one of the Chosen, he doesn’t know their orders. Moridin orders them to order all Darkfriends to watch for them. Only Moridin knows what was done to Mesaana for punishment. Moridin orders them to locate the three remaining seals, he will not let Cyndane near Rand because she would kill him. No one but Moridin is to harm Rand. Graendal insists Cynd is too weak to be Lancer but Aran is sure she is. Moridin orders them to kill Mat and Perrin. He thinks it will be easy to find them because they are tavern. Graendal says finding tavern is not that simple and is harder since the whole Pattern is in flux. This is the first time Semirhage has seen their faces, Aran’ thinks Moridin will be disappointed over Rand.</p> 

<h2>Ch 4, A Deal, Seanchan</h2>
<p><strong>Perrin.</strong> Oh wow wow wow… I want an end to this Shaido plot, but I’m not dreading it any longer. It seems to be going on for sometime now and it seems we’re going to dose the water supply with fork root lol. Also, I really hope the SC don’t learn how to Travel.. but it seems like the SC are going to be on Perrin’s side and maybe Rand’s side if anything is to be believed at face value with all these bargains with the SC. HMMMMM. Also, the Prophecies of the Dragon “the fox will marry the raven”… MAT AND TUON! WOW! Also, the Wolf King with a Hammer.. hey hey Perrin - it’s part of the Pattern! I’ve also wondered similar things about Berelain and her relatives! Turns out she is a distant cousin of sorts.. neat!</p>

<p>Perrin goes to meet the SC mediated by Tallanvor - Berelain is with him. They meet Captain-General Bakayar Mishima and Banner-General Tyler Khirgan. Perrin thinks Hopper would laugh at a Wolf King. Tylee notes Berelain's surname Paendrag; she is descended from Artur Paendrag Tanreall. Berelain claims only Mayene but she will defend it proudly. To show the prowess of his men, Perrin raises a flat branch into the air. From the woods three hundred paces away Jondyn Barran and Jori Congar shoot arrows into it. Then Jur Grady raises it into the air and flash burns it. The damane Norie puts out a small grassfire and her sul'dam reports that it was an Asha'man. Tod hands Perrin the Manetheren banner and he offers it to Tylee saying he will relinquish all claim of restoring Manetheren in Emond's Field and the Two Rivers if she helps him free Faile. A sulfurous gale suddenly blows through startling everyone. Tylee sends her soldiers back and Perrin has Dannil and Tell do the same. Perrin tells Tylee that Sevanna and the Shaido have three to four hundred channeling Wise Ones. Tylee does not have the resources to face that many.[5] She will have to disturb the Daughter of the Nine Moons and possibly apologize to the Empress. Mishima recalls the slaughter at Semalaren when there were four hundred damane on each side. Perrin heard that the Seanchan have something that knocks out channelers. He plans to put that in the Shaido water supply. Tylee says the manufactory is almost to Tarabon and she does not have the clout to get enough. Perrin says they can Travel and shows Tylee and Mishima the order from High Lady Suroth. Tylee is thoroughly impressed and wants to know who Perrin really is. He is a man who wants his wife back and will deal with the Dark One to get her. He and the Seanchan have a deal. </p>
