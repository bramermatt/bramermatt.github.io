<p>"The sweetness of victory and the bitterness of defeat are alike a knife of dreams. —from Fog and Steel by Madoc Comadrin</p>

<h2>Prologue, Embers Falling on Dry Grass, Wheel and Snake</h2>
<p><strong>Galad.</strong> OH DANG! Galad is Lord Captain Commander of the White Cloaks and has gained a heron marked blade for killing Eamon Valda in Children of the Light challenge!! BOOM WHAT A START! </p>

<p>Galad is riding along a road in Amadicia with Trom, Dain Bornhald, and Jaret Byar. The Whitecloaks are now allied with the SC. They are heading to a manor house once belonging to Ailron that the SC gave to Eamon Valda. Galad plans to kill Valda. Bornhald an dByar told him that Valda assulted and killed Morgase. Trom and Galad have both been promoted to Lord Captain because three of the high officers were killed by ht eSC at Jeramel. At the manor there are 50 regular WC and half a dozen Questioners led by Rhadam Asunawa. Valda is angry with Trom because he is supposed to be headed to Nassad with other Lords Captain to meet with the SC. </p>

<p>Galad challenges Valda and Asunawa objects and wants to arrest Galad - Valda accepts. Galad studied under Henre Haslin and Gareth Bryne. Galad kills Valda after an awesome battle. Most of the WC claps, Asunawa and the Questioners are gone. They rode toward Nassad. Galad's supporters believe Asunawa has gone to talk the other Lords Captain into arresting him. Galad wants to seek other allies to oppose the SC. A Cairhienin named Doirellin and the others agree. Galad tells them they might have to ally with the AS and the Asha'man if they want to fight at The Last Battle. The men agree. Whitecloak law says it is allowable to ally with the serpent to fight the raven and Galad is now the new Lord Captain Commander.</p>

<p><strong>Ituralde.</strong> Sneaky plans Ituralde.. and I know none of them lol. </p>

<p>Rodel Ituralde leads 100 Domani and three hundred Tarabon. Tornay Lanasiet leads 200 Tarabon. They are near the village of Serana in Tarabon halfway between Elmora and Amadicia. There is a SC camp nearby. They ride into view of the camp surprising the SC and Tarabon there. The defenders mount a charge and seem to trample a few people in the field.. ghosts?? Lanasiet's men charge forward but Ituralde has his archers take out the SC command along with a sul'dam and damane. When the SC and Tarabon survivors flee, Lanasiet and his men chase. Jaalam rides up - there are no bodies on the field where the people were standing. Ituralde orders him to burn the warehouse. He has 20,000 men all over Tarabon on similar raids. He means to work his way north and re-gather his men, and he expects the SC to follow. They will fall into the trap he has set in Almoth Plain, if they see the trap he has a backup plan.</p> 

<p><strong>Suroth.</strong> Holy crap! Well so much for meeting the Empress lol. I have been wanting to meet the Empress for some books now, and now I guess I have already met her lololol. So Semirhage is using the Balzamon trick huh lol - that's awesome, I'm glad that's back! Suroth.. I am EXCITED TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS! The entire Imperial family, including the Empress Radhanan are dead, Seandar is in chaos and there is war from Aldael Mountains to Salaking.. "let the Lord of Chaos rule". Also Liandrin is here and is going to be collared! WOO! wait.. morally ambiguous lol. </p>

<p>Dawn is nearing in Ebou Dar and High Lady Suroth still cannot sleep. She wonders if Tuon is alive or dead. It has been seventeen days. She thinks the escape of the Atha'an Miere damane and death of Tylin mean Tuon is dead. Someone is trying to disrupt the Return. Two of her own sul'dam, Renna and Seta, disappeared at the same time. Egeanin Tamarath stole a pair of damane and also disappeared. If Tuon is, indeed, dead Suroth will have to apologize to the Empress. If that happens she will kill herself before reaching Seandar. She still has some hope. Tuon's der'sul'dam left nine days ago with all her sul'dam and damane. Captain Musenge left at the same time with many of his men. She worries that someone may suspect she is Atha'an Shadar, a Darkfriend.</p>

<p>The door opens and Liandrin enters dressed as da'covale. Almandaragal, her lopar, prepares to defend her. Liandrin professes her loyalty citing how she killed Alwhin. She brings a message from an officer of Captain-General Galgan to summon Suroth. Suroth thinks it is time to have a sul'dam collar Liandrin; she will send Elbar to find another Darkfriend.</p>

<p>She sends Liandrin to Rosala for a beating then goes to her anteroom where Banner-General Mikhel Najirah awaits. She has a screen decorated with a kori, a huge spotted cat from the Sen T'jore. He escorts her through the palace where Beslan is now king. Captain-General Lunal Galgan's ancestors date back to Luthair Paendrag Mondwin. He tells her that raken began arriving three hours ago with reports from Lieutenant-General Turan of dozens of raids in Tarabon. Rodel Ituralde was behind them. She orders them to bring her Ituralde's head. She orders Captain of the Air Yulan to put most of his raken on the hunt. He wants to save some for Banner-General Khirgan and to search for the Aiel and seven thousand deserter Whitecloaks in Amadicia. Galgan does not object as long as he has the to'raken he needs for Altara and Illian.</p>

<p>She returns to her rooms where Semirhage appears masked in fire. Semirhage offers to make her Empress. Suroth is terrified, but Semirhage tells her that Empress Radhanan and all the imperial family is dead. Seandar is in chaos and there is war from the Aldael Mountains to Salaking. She laughs and says, "Let the Lord of Chaos rule." Suroth is horrified that even one of the Da'concion, the Chosen Ones, could do that. Semirhage orders her to put all her efforts to killing Tuon and to expanding the rumor that she is an impostor. Suroth agrees. She will send Elbar with thousands of men.</p>

<p><strong>Pevara.</strong> Oh yes, Black Ajah plots! Pevara is ready to bond an Asha'man! I was pumped about this Supreme Council meeting that this crew is about to disrupt.. wow! Pevara wants to bring Zerah and the others to attack the meeting, BUT Yukiri convinces her it is a bad idea. They know now that Elaida's mission was to find treason in Alviarin, not hunt the BA.. lol. Also these Reds know that Damar Flinn has Healed the stilling! WOO! </p>

<p><strong>Alviarin.</strong> Alviarin retrieves a secret message and returns to her quarters. She is still overwhelmed by her experience with Shaidar Haran, the Great Lord in her eyes. The whole White Ajah is ashamed of her for being demoted from Keeper. She is still sore from her penances with Silviana. Katerine spread the news of Dumai's Wells through the Black Ajah. In her rooms she decodes the message and two others. One reports that Talene left the White Tower yesterday, before the Supreme Council meeting. Alviarin is now certain there was something between her and Yukiri and Doesine. Alviarin is afraid to call Mesaana who probably wants to kill her. She writes orders to find Talene and to keep close watch on Yukiri and Doesine.</p>

<p><strong>Galina.</strong> Can it be this book Faile is saved?? I am hopeful! Galina is gai'shain white now! She plans to get back at Elaida, Therava still owns her, and she can't channel without permission. She wants to get the Oath Rod to remove her obedience oaths.. then Gual and Neald pop in and remove her. She's brought back to Perrin's camp and talks with them going by the name Alyse. Perrin has Galina verify the accuracy of his maps of Malden and the surrounding Shaido camp. Perrin asks about what the Wise One's drink and if it's only water... they're going to poison the water-hole! I don't remember where that reference comes from lol. He asks her to warn Faile to go to Lady Cairen's fortress at the north end of the city and hide when she hears wolves during the day. Lying, Galina says she will. After retrieving her horse Neald takes her back to the Shaido camp. She is late and Therava punishes her. She plans to get the Oath Rod, kill Faile and her friends, and escape.</p>

<p><strong>Egwene.</strong> Oh yeah, I'm ready for this. But, really? We've stopped the progress or is everyone else going to start the siege now that Eg has been captured?? What are we going to do now?? </p>

<p>Eg is riding in a carriage through TV from Northarbor to the WT. 5 AS are with her Katerine, Barasine (REDS), Felaana (BROWN), Pritalle (YELLOW), Berisha (GRAY). They seem to be at each other's throats. Jala and Merym went ahead to report to Elaida. They forkrooted Eg. Eg tells them she converted the harbor chain to cuendillar.. wow! Nicola is there in novice white, Elaida wants Eg sent to Silviana. Nicola apologizes. Leane has been captured too, she converted half the chain there. Elaida has reduced Eg to novice, but otherwise nto punished her. Eg tells her she is a Dreamer and warns them of the coming SC attack. Eg is escorted back to the novice quaters and she enters TAR and she wants to warn Siuan and Eg is going to start working on the WT from within.</p>
