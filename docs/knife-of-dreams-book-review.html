<h2>Header</h2>
<p>"The sweetness of victory and the bitterness of defeat are alike a knife of dreams. —from Fog and Steel by Madoc Comadrin</p>

<h2>Prologue, Embers Falling on Dry Grass, Wheel and Snake</h2>
<p><strong>Galad.</strong> OH DANG! Galad is Lord Captain Commander of the White Cloaks and has gained a heron marked blade for killing Eamon Valda in Children of the Light challenge!! BOOM WHAT A START! </p>

<p>Galad is riding along a road in Amadicia with Trom, Dain Bornhald, and Jaret Byar. The Whitecloaks are now allied with the SC. They are heading to a manor house once belonging to Ailron that the SC gave to Eamon Valda. Galad plans to kill Valda. Bornhald an dByar told him that Valda assulted and killed Morgase. Trom and Galad have both been promoted to Lord Captain because three of the high officers were killed by ht eSC at Jeramel. At the manor there are 50 regular WC and half a dozen Questioners led by Rhadam Asunawa. Valda is angry with Trom because he is supposed to be headed to Nassad with other Lords Captain to meet with the SC. </p>

<p>Galad challenges Valda and Asunawa objects and wants to arrest Galad - Valda accepts. Galad studied under Henre Haslin and Gareth Bryne. Galad kills Valda after an awesome battle. Most of the WC claps, Asunawa and the Questioners are gone. They rode toward Nassad. Galad's supporters believe Asunawa has gone to talk the other Lords Captain into arresting him. Galad wants to seek other allies to oppose the SC. A Cairhienin named Doirellin and the others agree. Galad tells them they might have to ally with the AS and the Asha'man if they want to fight at The Last Battle. The men agree. Whitecloak law says it is allowable to ally with the serpent to fight the raven and Galad is now the new Lord Captain Commander.</p>

<p><strong>Ituralde.</strong> Sneaky plans Ituralde.. and I know none of them lol. </p>

<p>Rodel Ituralde leads 100 Domani and three hundred Tarabon. Tornay Lanasiet leads 200 Tarabon. They are near the village of Serana in Tarabon halfway between Elmora and Amadicia. There is a SC camp nearby. They ride into view of the camp surprising the SC and Tarabon there. The defenders mount a charge and seem to trample a few people in the field.. ghosts?? Lanasiet's men charge forward but Ituralde has his archers take out the SC command along with a sul'dam and damane. When the SC and Tarabon survivors flee, Lanasiet and his men chase. Jaalam rides up - there are no bodies on the field where the people were standing. Ituralde orders him to burn the warehouse. He has 20,000 men all over Tarabon on similar raids. He means to work his way north and re-gather his men, and he expects the SC to follow. They will fall into the trap he has set in Almoth Plain, if they see the trap he has a backup plan.</p> 

<p><strong>Suroth.</strong> Holy crap! Well so much for meeting the Empress lol. I have been wanting to meet the Empress for some books now, and now I guess I have already met her lololol. So Semirhage is using the Balzamon trick huh lol - that's awesome, I'm glad that's back! Suroth.. I am EXCITED TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS! The entire Imperial family, including the Empress Radhanan are dead, Seandar is in chaos and there is war from Aldael Mountains to Salaking.. "let the Lord of Chaos rule". Also Liandrin is here and is going to be collared! WOO! wait.. morally ambiguous lol. </p>

<p>Dawn is nearing in Ebou Dar and High Lady Suroth still cannot sleep. She wonders if Tuon is alive or dead. It has been seventeen days. She thinks the escape of the Atha'an Miere damane and death of Tylin mean Tuon is dead. Someone is trying to disrupt the Return. Two of her own sul'dam, Renna and Seta, disappeared at the same time. Egeanin Tamarath stole a pair of damane and also disappeared. If Tuon is, indeed, dead Suroth will have to apologize to the Empress. If that happens she will kill herself before reaching Seandar. She still has some hope. Tuon's der'sul'dam left nine days ago with all her sul'dam and damane. Captain Musenge left at the same time with many of his men. She worries that someone may suspect she is Atha'an Shadar, a Darkfriend.</p>

<p>The door opens and Liandrin enters dressed as da'covale. Almandaragal, her lopar, prepares to defend her. Liandrin professes her loyalty citing how she killed Alwhin. She brings a message from an officer of Captain-General Galgan to summon Suroth. Suroth thinks it is time to have a sul'dam collar Liandrin; she will send Elbar to find another Darkfriend.</p>

<p>She sends Liandrin to Rosala for a beating then goes to her anteroom where Banner-General Mikhel Najirah awaits. She has a screen decorated with a kori, a huge spotted cat from the Sen T'jore. He escorts her through the palace where Beslan is now king. Captain-General Lunal Galgan's ancestors date back to Luthair Paendrag Mondwin. He tells her that raken began arriving three hours ago with reports from Lieutenant-General Turan of dozens of raids in Tarabon. Rodel Ituralde was behind them. She orders them to bring her Ituralde's head. She orders Captain of the Air Yulan to put most of his raken on the hunt. He wants to save some for Banner-General Khirgan and to search for the Aiel and seven thousand deserter Whitecloaks in Amadicia. Galgan does not object as long as he has the to'raken he needs for Altara and Illian.</p>

<p>She returns to her rooms where Semirhage appears masked in fire. Semirhage offers to make her Empress. Suroth is terrified, but Semirhage tells her that Empress Radhanan and all the imperial family is dead. Seandar is in chaos and there is war from the Aldael Mountains to Salaking. She laughs and says, "Let the Lord of Chaos rule." Suroth is horrified that even one of the Da'concion, the Chosen Ones, could do that. Semirhage orders her to put all her efforts to killing Tuon and to expanding the rumor that she is an impostor. Suroth agrees. She will send Elbar with thousands of men.</p>

<p><strong>Pevara.</strong> Oh yes, Black Ajah plots! Pevara is ready to bond an Asha'man! I was pumped about this Supreme Council meeting that this crew is about to disrupt.. wow! Pevara wants to bring Zerah and the others to attack the meeting, BUT Yukiri convinces her it is a bad idea. They know now that Elaida's mission was to find treason in Alviarin, not hunt the BA.. lol. Also these Reds know that Damar Flinn has Healed the stilling! WOO! </p>

<p><strong>Alviarin.</strong> Alviarin retrieves a secret message and returns to her quarters. She is still overwhelmed by her experience with Shaidar Haran, the Great Lord in her eyes. The whole White Ajah is ashamed of her for being demoted from Keeper. She is still sore from her penances with Silviana. Katerine spread the news of Dumai's Wells through the Black Ajah. In her rooms she decodes the message and two others. One reports that Talene left the White Tower yesterday, before the Supreme Council meeting. Alviarin is now certain there was something between her and Yukiri and Doesine. Alviarin is afraid to call Mesaana who probably wants to kill her. She writes orders to find Talene and to keep close watch on Yukiri and Doesine.</p>

<p><strong>Galina.</strong> Can it be this book Faile is saved?? I am hopeful! Galina is gai'shain white now! She plans to get back at Elaida, Therava still owns her, and she can't channel without permission. She wants to get the Oath Rod to remove her obedience oaths.. then Gual and Neald pop in and remove her. She's brought back to Perrin's camp and talks with them going by the name Alyse. Perrin has Galina verify the accuracy of his maps of Malden and the surrounding Shaido camp. Perrin asks about what the Wise One's drink and if it's only water... they're going to poison the water-hole! I don't remember where that reference comes from lol. He asks her to warn Faile to go to Lady Cairen's fortress at the north end of the city and hide when she hears wolves during the day. Lying, Galina says she will. After retrieving her horse Neald takes her back to the Shaido camp. She is late and Therava punishes her. She plans to get the Oath Rod, kill Faile and her friends, and escape.</p>

<p><strong>Egwene.</strong> Oh yeah, I'm ready for this. But, really? We've stopped the progress or is everyone else going to start the siege now that Eg has been captured?? What are we going to do now?? </p>

<p>Eg is riding in a carriage through TV from Northarbor to the WT. 5 AS are with her Katerine, Barasine (REDS), Felaana (BROWN), Pritalle (YELLOW), Berisha (GRAY). They seem to be at each other's throats. Jala and Merym went ahead to report to Elaida. They forkrooted Eg. Eg tells them she converted the harbor chain to cuendillar.. wow! Nicola is there in novice white, Elaida wants Eg sent to Silviana. Nicola apologizes. Leane has been captured too, she converted half the chain there. Elaida has reduced Eg to novice, but otherwise nto punished her. Eg tells her she is a Dreamer and warns them of the coming SC attack. Eg is escorted back to the novice quaters and she enters TAR and she wants to warn Siuan and Eg is going to start working on the WT from within.</p>

<h2>Ch 1, When Last Sounds, TAR</h2>
<p><strong>Siuan.</strong> Oh this is very good! I’m excited now. See at the end of COT I didn’t really care that Eg was captured. I felt like it was just prolonging the plot from happening. Because, and this is my fault for thinking this, I thought the Salidar Aes Sedai would be storming the Tower and it would be a huge gigantic battle since there were a lot of soldiers and Aes Sedai and Novices. And now, I don’t know what is going to happen… Also, I absolutely love the wind starting from Dragonmount, what a powerful image. Feels like this is going to be a good book to me! Siuan’s ability to Heal is strong since Nynaeve Healded her.. interesting. Lelaine also wants to betray Egweene… yuck.</p>

<p>A wind rises at the peak of Dragonmount and carries a sulfurous smell east past the Salidar Aes Sedai camp and to the army camp where it wakes Siuan.  She lights a lantern with Fire. Bryne is still out and about. She is angry and confused about her feelings toward him. She sees that he blacked his own boots and angrily removes it with Earth, Fire and Air. Min told her she has to stay close to him. The sudden wind wrecked the camp and many people are injured. Her ability to Heal is strong since Nynaeve Healed her.</p>

<p>She borrows a horse, Nightlily, that belongs to Nemaris, a campfollower's wife. Nightlily is not as mild as Bela and she has a rough ride to the Salidar Aes Sedai camp. Arriving at the Salidar Aes Sedai camp she weaves Spirit to hide her ability to channel. She passes Sheriam's and Morvrin's dark tents and stops at Myrelle's. Three Warder, Arinvar, Avar Hachami, and Jori stand guard. She first weaves Air and a hint of Fire to eavesdrop but the tent is warded. She goes inside and finds Myrelle, Morvrin, Carlinya and Sheriam. Siuan reports the Egwene and Leane are alive and well and that they mostly succeeded. Beonin went to bed and they have ousted Nisao from their group. Sheriam wants to Travel to free them but Egwene ordered no rescue. They do not understand why Elaida did not order an immediate trial. Sheriam is still angry because Elaida abolished the Blue Ajah.</p>

<p>Lelaine Akashi enters. They tell her about Egwene and she asks Siuan to walk with her. Outside, Burin, Nuhel Dromand, Arinvar and Jori wait. Burin joins Lelaine. She tells Siuan that she uncovered Faolain's spying and kept her confined.  Siuan tells her that Egwene ordered a sitting of the Hall in the White Tower in Tel'aran'rhiod when Last sounds the next night. She keeps the betrayal a secret because someone in the Hall was the leak. Lelaine tells Siuan to support her for the Amyrlin against Romanda if Egwene dies or is stilled. Siuan worries that Lelaine now also has reason to betray Egwene. </p>

<h2>Ch 2, The Dark One’s Touch, Aes Sedai</h2>
<p><strong>Beonin.</strong> This is a neat perspective. Food is spoiling and Beonin thinks the Dark One is touching the world. She also thinks that Rand has much to answer for but the Dragon Reborn must win the LB. Beonin seized the moment when Elaida deposed Siuan and she has adjusted since then. The AS are all on edge because of the murders of Anaiya and Kaire.. duh lol. It’s Halima y’all. Both Anaiya and Kairen were Blues and had contact with Moraine and Rand… are we getting Moiraine this book???? Beonin suggests a connection with Asha’man. Beonin rides to the Traveling ground.. awesome! She weaves a gateway with Spirit to a grove near the WT, she loves weaving the gateway.. I agree it’s pretty awesome. When they arrive, she sees the ghost of Turanin Merdagon who died forty years ago when Beonin was Accepted. She weaves Illusion to disguise herself and sends her Warder Tervail to find and inn and she goes into the WT to find Elaida…. Why?</p>

<p><strong>Elaida.</strong> Mattin Stepaneos is not dead! Cool. He was kidnapped from Illian before Rand came and just arrived yesterday - Elaida has a plan to get him the crown back. Beonin comes in and tells Elaida about Egwene telling everyone she's alive and such. Then says she is good at the new Healing and then shows gateways for Traveling and Skimming. Elaida tells her not to tell anyone those weaves without her permission. Beonin tells her about the ten moles including Meidani and Elaida wants to have the moles watched and invite Meidani to dinner. Beonin can teach Tarna all the new weaves and Elaida orders Beonin to show her everything. Also the Wards are failing against rats lol. </p>

<p>Tarna enters and reports that Southharbor is only slightly functional. After the rebels are defeated Elaida intends to add their army to the Tower Guard. Gareth Bryne is a much better captain than High Captain Jimar Chubain. The streets of Tar Valon are filthy because workers are afraid of the ghosts. Elaida has studied writings on the Last Battle and the ghosts mean it is coming soon. She thinks she will soon have Elayne back in hand. There is news of Tarabon rebelling against the Seanchan. The Tar Valon sewers are clogged. There are rats in the White Tower; the Wards are failing. </p>

<h2>Traveling</h2>
<p>Okay I have a lot of thoughts. About the Ways and Traveling and Gateways and Skimming. This might sound a bit jumbled but here we go.. So, the Ways were created by male channelers right? or was it just the Aes Sedai at during the AOL? Anyways.. so my thought/prediction is the Ways / Waygates are a tied off wWeave / Standing weave / Keeping weave of a gaTraveling Gateway (not the instant jump from one place to another, but ) but a place that has bridges and walkways built up for walking... now with the Black Wind.. no idea on that lol. But that's my thought. Since non-channelers can use the Ways. Also, the use of the trefoil Avendesora leaf.. hmm. I don't know, but that is my thought and I'm excited to RAFO!</p>

<h2>Ch 3, At the Gardens, Forsnaken</h2>
<p><strong>Aran'gar.</strong> Holy smokes I haven't even read two pages and so many things have been revealed. WHOA! Alright. Aran'gar is Bathamel, because they talked about Aginor. And Moridin is Ishameael, at least Aran'gar has no doubt. I've been saying that since book seven! WOO! </p>

<p>So let’s go! The remaining Forsaken are in TAR, summoned by Moridin. Graendal, Demandred, Mesaana and Semirhage are there, there are 11 chairs. Asmo, Sammael, Be’lal, and Rahvin are dead, Osan’gar hasn’t been seen since SL (Winter’s Heart) - because he was killed by Elza! Zomara serve wine, Moridin / Ishamael found a stasis box with dozens of Zomaran. Aran’gar found two but they only heard rubbish, she is wearing an emerald necklace from Delana, Aran’gar is weak in TAR. She can only find Eg’s dream when she sleeps next to her. Graendal has a lot of Darkfriend contacts. Aran’gar propositions Graendal.. Mesaana is angry at Aran’gar because she lost Egwene and the rebellion will fall apart. Aran’gar tells her the rebellion is holding and Mesaana will wait until Elaida breaks Eg, Mesaana won’t tell where Eg is held. </p>

<p>Moridin comes in with Mogi and Cyndane (Lanfear!), Moridin is Nae’blis. Moridin says Sammael or someone disguised as him ordered 100 Fades and 1000s of Trollocs into the Ways. It must have been one of the Chosen, he doesn’t know their orders. Moridin orders them to order all Darkfriends to watch for them. Only Moridin knows what was done to Mesaana for punishment. Moridin orders them to locate the three remaining seals, he will not let Cyndane near Rand because she would kill him. No one but Moridin is to harm Rand. Graendal insists Cynd is too weak to be Lancer but Aran is sure she is. Moridin orders them to kill Mat and Perrin. He thinks it will be easy to find them because they are tavern. Graendal says finding tavern is not that simple and is harder since the whole Pattern is in flux. This is the first time Semirhage has seen their faces, Aran’ thinks Moridin will be disappointed over Rand.</p> 

<h2>Ch 4, A Deal, Seanchan</h2>
<p><strong>Perrin.</strong> Oh wow wow wow… I want an end to this Shaido plot, but I’m not dreading it any longer. It seems to be going on for sometime now and it seems we’re going to dose the water supply with fork root lol. Also, I really hope the SC don’t learn how to Travel.. but it seems like the SC are going to be on Perrin’s side and maybe Rand’s side if anything is to be believed at face value with all these bargains with the SC. HMMMMM. Also, the Prophecies of the Dragon “the fox will marry the raven”… MAT AND TUON! WOW! Also, the Wolf King with a Hammer.. hey hey Perrin - it’s part of the Pattern! I’ve also wondered similar things about Berelain and her relatives! Turns out she is a distant cousin of sorts.. neat!</p>

<p>Perrin goes to meet the SC mediated by Tallanvor - Berelain is with him. They meet Captain-General Bakayar Mishima and Banner-General Tyler Khirgan. Perrin thinks Hopper would laugh at a Wolf King. Tylee notes Berelain's surname Paendrag; she is descended from Artur Paendrag Tanreall. Berelain claims only Mayene but she will defend it proudly. To show the prowess of his men, Perrin raises a flat branch into the air. From the woods three hundred paces away Jondyn Barran and Jori Congar shoot arrows into it. Then Jur Grady raises it into the air and flash burns it. The damane Norie puts out a small grassfire and her sul'dam reports that it was an Asha'man. Tod hands Perrin the Manetheren banner and he offers it to Tylee saying he will relinquish all claim of restoring Manetheren in Emond's Field and the Two Rivers if she helps him free Faile. A sulfurous gale suddenly blows through startling everyone. Tylee sends her soldiers back and Perrin has Dannil and Tell do the same. Perrin tells Tylee that Sevanna and the Shaido have three to four hundred channeling Wise Ones. Tylee does not have the resources to face that many. She will have to disturb the Daughter of the Nine Moons and possibly apologize to the Empress. Mishima recalls the slaughter at Semalaren when there were four hundred damane on each side. Perrin heard that the Seanchan have something that knocks out channelers. He plans to put that in the Shaido water supply. Tylee says the manufactory is almost to Tarabon and she does not have the clout to get enough. Perrin says they can Travel and shows Tylee and Mishima the order from High Lady Suroth. Tylee is thoroughly impressed and wants to know who Perrin really is. He is a man who wants his wife back and will deal with the Dark One to get her. He and the Seanchan have a deal. </p>

<h2>Ch 5, Something…Strange, Wheel and Snake</h2>
<p><strong>Faile.</strong> Hey, not a bad Faile chapter lol. Alright, to summarize… there was something strange that happened…. It’s been a month since Faile was caught with a knife and nearly two months since she was captured. Rolan keeps saving her. Galina had her hair singed off from Theresa. Lusaka serves Theresa water, she and Aravine sworn to Faile in the last two weeks. I’m really interested to see the little things that happen after Perrin and crew poison the water! Therava tells Sevanna that many pet chiefs still try to use their nar’baha, Bendhuin of the Green Salts left for Rhuidean five days ago. There are 14 septs around Malden and two more, the Moral and the White Cliff are days away. Aravine arrives and reports that Alvin and his son Theril have something… it’s the Oath Rod that was in Theresa’s tent! Then Roman shows up and everyone leaves and he tells Faile that he and other Mer’adin (brotherless) plan to return tot he Aiel Waste - where he will take Faile with him! He will let her go when they make it into a town. File hides the OR in the town and Therava has discovered it was taken and starts a search! </p>

<h2>Ch 6, A Stave and a Arazor, Dice</h2>
<p><strong>Mat.</strong> Ahhh, I love this book. Mat buys astave of black yew to carve a longbow, Colors swirl and Mat sees Rand and Min kissing. There aren't ghosts today. Mat also buys a horse, a razor, after some bargaining he learned from his dad. Mat now calls Tuon Precious and Mat asks Noal if he is related to Jain Charin, and Noal says he was a cousin... uh oh! Olver's favorite book is The Travels of Jain Farstrider. Olver stays in a tent with Juilin and Thera. Noal says he was a fool who went on adventures while his wife died of fever. "He let himself be made into a tool by—" and then his face goes blank. Olver recalls that Jain Charin captured Cowin Gemallan after he betrayed Malkier to the Shadow. Juilin enters and reports that Seanchan soldiers have arrived. Woo.</p>

<h2>Ch 7, A Cold Medallion, A'dam</h2>
<p><strong>Mat.</strong> Bethamin (sul'dam) is channeling, Mat feels the fox medallion go cold, and he comes in and Joline is slapping Bethamin. Mat stops her and she slapps him, the other AS try to stop Mat and they are shocked about his foxhead medallion, Setalle asks if she can see the ter'angreal that he must have and she thinks that Cadsuane had one like it. She knows baout the test for the shawl as well. Edesina boud them with Air - they are going to train Bethamin or she would die. The dice are still rolling. </p>

<h2>Ch 8, Dragon's Eggs, Leaf / Tinkers!</h2>
<p><strong>Mat.</strong> With a title like Dragons' Eggs I thought we were getting an Elayne perspective hahahah, but that would've been Dragon('s) instead of Dragon(s') ah well here we go! Mat gets more colors of Rand with Loial and Rand eating... after hearing more rumors of Rand. Aludra needed a bellfounder to make bronze lofting tubes for her firewords - to avenge the Illumintors and attack the SC. She will call the tubes dragons and the charges dragons' eggs. Aludra agrees to go with Mat and one set of the dice stop rattling. Mat gives Tuon the razor horse - another set of the dice stop. They come up to a Tinker caravan and Tuon gallops off. Tuon names the razer Akein (swallow). There are some ruins ahead and Mat sees some hills he recognizes as The Dancers and knows this was Londaren Cor, the capital city of Eharon. He also remembers dying in a battle near the hills when Nerevan and Esandara invaded Shiota. Mat wonders how the Eelfinn collected memories from dead men. Mat thinks they must create a link so they must still be in his head, too. I WANT MORE OF THIS PLEASE!!! Selucia catches up and says the TuathaAn are following. Mat talks with the Seeker while Tuon and Selucia talk with the women. The TuathaAn are heading toward Ebou Dar because they have heard the Seanchan offer safety. TuathaAn take their women who can channel straight to Tar Valon. After appeasing the TuathaAn, Mat, Tuon and Selucia ride back to the circus.</p>

<h2>Ch 9, A Short Path, Wheel and Snake</h2>
<p><strong>Mat.</strong> Oh yeah, go Mat! So, Setalle was once Aes Sedai - yep I could've guessed that lol. Mat does something incredible and saves Joline and Teslyn from the a'dam and then buries them.. awesome!</p>

<p>Luca lets slip to the Aes Sedai that Tuon is a High Lady and they begin badgering her to negotiate a truce with the Seanchan. One evening Lopin and Nerim prepare supper for Mat, Tuon, Selucia, Noal and Olver. After Olver leaves, Noal tells stories about the Seven Towers in Malkier and Shol Arbela, the City of Ten Thousand Bells, in Arafel. Joline, Teslyn and Edesina enter and demand that she end the war before Tarmon Gai'don. Selucia slips an a'dam onto Teslyn and in the confusion puts one on Joline as well. Tuon has the bracelets. Edesina tries to run but Tuon binds her with Air and slams the door on Blaeric and Fen. Tuon demonstrates the a'dam on Joline. Mat tries to talk her into letting them go but she refuses. He moves toward them and the foxhead medallion grows cold. Tuon is shocked. Mat releases Teslyn then makes all three agree to stop annoying Tuon. Then he releases Joline. Mat buries the three a'dam in a deep hole and gets soaked with a cold rain for his trouble. The dice are still tumbling in his head.</p>

<h2>Ch 10, A Village in Shiota, Snake and Foxes</h2>
<p><strong>Mat.</strong> HOLY CRAP. DUDE. HOLY CRAP. MOIRAINE IS COMING BACK. GOOD LORD. I AM SCREAMING. I LOVE THIS SO MUCH. WOW WOW WOW. THIS WAS A PERFECT CHAPTER. WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW. Let me collect myself and come back to write what the heck just happened lol.</p>

<p>Tuon is rekindling Mat's memories about the Aelfinn and Eelfin.. I love this. And then they come to a village and it MELTS INTO THE GROUND?! Ghosts, right? lol The circus will continue to Lugard. Mat asks Thom about his letter and it was in fact the letter from Moiraine and as follows... The letter says Thom should show it to Mat only when he asks. She writes that she will confront Lanfear shortly but she will not die. Thom, Mat and one other must try to rescue her. Mat knows the way. She wishes the best for Lan and Nynaeve. Remember the game of Snakes and Foxes. Mat is not sure; he saw the twisted red doorway melt. And then Olver says Birgitte told him the Tower of Ghenjei is the way to the Aelfinna and Eelfin!! YES YES YES CALLBACK! To enter you have to draw the Snakes and Foxes sign on it with a bronze knife to open the door! Noal mentioned Jain thought it was on the Shadow Coast?? Mat recognizes the description as the tower he saw after feleing Shadar Logoth, Domon can lead them there. Mat warns them about the Ael and Eel and tells them the whole story, Noal offers to be the third and the dice stop as Mat agrees.... YES!</p>

<p>Mat sees ravens fly by and tells Tuon they could be spies for the Dark One. Tuon thinks it is a children's tale and asks if Mat believes that, if you sleep on Old Hob's Hill under a full moon, the snakes will give you true answers to three questions, or that foxes steal people's skins and take the nourishment from food so you can starve to death while eating your fill? Mat is startled at these references to the Aelfinn and Eelfinn. Old Hob, Caisen Hob, was a name for the Dark One in Shandalle where Artur Hawkwing was born. </p>

<p>They come to an odd looking village and see a peddler driving his wagon through. Mat recognizes the houses as ancient Shiotan construction. The village starts to melt into the ground. The peddler and his horses scream as they sink into the ground as well. Soon nothing is left but the road. Teslyn, Edesina, Joline, Blaeric and Fen examine the area but find nothing. People are scared to continue. Luca argues that they should continue to Lugard but most want to go back to Ebou Dar, Illian or somewhere west. Thom, Juilin, Amathera, Noal and Olver join Mat. Thom bets Mat that Luca will convince the circus to continue to Lugard and he wins. Luca and Latelle lead the troupe forward at a gallop. Tuon says the dead walking is a sign of Tarmon Gai'don.</p>

<p>That evening Lopin and Nerim serve dinner but no one eats much and Mat sends them to join Harnan and the Redarms. Domon and Egeanin invite Juilin and Amathera to their tent for a drink. They are all changing, becoming more accepting.</p>

<p>Thom reads his letter from Moiraine and Mat finally asks him about it. The letter says Thom should show it to Mat only when he asks. She writes that she will confront Lanfear shortly but she will not die. Thom, Mat and one other must try to rescue her. Mat knows the way. She wishes the best for Lan and Nynaeve. Remember the game of Snakes and Foxes. Mat is not sure; he saw the twisted red doorway melt. Olver says Birgitte told him the Tower of Ghenjei is a way to the Aelfinn and Eelfinn. Draw the Snakes and Foxes sign on it with a bronze knife to open the door. Noal says Jain Farstrider thought it was on the Shadow Coast. He describes it and Mat recognizes the description as the tower he saw after fleeing Shadar Logoth. He says Domon can lead them there. He warns them that the Aelfinn and Eelfinn know what is in his mind and tells them the whole story. Noal offers to be their third. Mat agrees to go and the final set of dice in his head stop.</p>

<h2>Ch 11, A Hell in Maderin, Dice</h2>
<p><strong>Mat.</strong> Tuon wants to go to an Inn. They go to one, The White Ring, Mat dices to a game (Match) a game popular 1,000 years before Artur Hawkwing (his memories). Mat is playing against three Altaran merchants Camrin, Kostelle and Vane, and a Taraboner merchant, Mistress Alstaing. Vane leaves suddenly. After they return to their table, Thom returns with news that the gholam killed in Jurador. Mat recalls he can fight it with the foxhead medallion. </p>

<p>There is also a Seanchan army ahead on the border of Murandy. They make anyone passing through drink an herbal tea. The sul'dam collar anyone who gets wobbly. (THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY SMART IDEA ON THE SC PART). They are also looking for a Tuon impostor. They begin planning to leave Luca and the circus. They will take Vanin and the redarms as well as Aludra. Mat wants to head east if Vanin knows a pass through the mountains.</p>

<p>When Tuon and Selucia return, Mat and Thom hustle them out of the inn. Tuon thinks the plot may be engineered by her sisters Ravashi or Chimal. Aurana is too young. Mat promises to get her to safety. Suddenly several approaching men pull their swords and attack. Together they kill all the attackers. Tuon kills the only woman. Mat recognizes one of the men as Vane. Out of nowhere, Thom apologizes for seeing things that cannot be and Selucia nods, Thom must've seen that Selucia was an awesome fighter! Having killed a local merchant, Mat realizes they must leave immediately and abandon Luca's circus. WOO! But what about Aludra?? And every single other person that are supposed to be with Mat? </p>

<h2>Ch 12, A Manufactory, Wolf</h2>
<p><strong>Perrin.</strong> Perrin and crew go into a town Almizar.. and talk to some Seanchan. Faile has been prisoner fifty-one days. Perrin is showing off that Suroth note to all the Seanchan peeps. People are dying to beetles and then Perrin's crew is getting some raken and a LOT OF FORKROOT! Also, Perrin's eyes are noticed and then a darkfriend tries to kill him with an arrow and... ta'veren! </p>

<p>Perrin is sure she must be alive because Alyse is protecting her. Perrin thinks of Mat and sees an image of him riding into a forest. There are numerous Tinker caravans camped near the town - Elyas told him that such large gatherings are rare except at their annual Sunday meeting. Neald scoffs at the TuathaAn for cowards but Perrin defends them telling how they protected the children when Trollocs attacked Emond's Field. Carlon Belcelona holds Stayer and Perrin and the Seanchan enter a large farmhouse that serves as the Seanchan military headquarters. The commander is Captain Blasic Faloun.</p> 

<p>As Khirgan asks to speak with him in private, a clerk named Mehtan vomits beetles until only his skin is left. Everyone is in terror shouting that it is Soulblinder's work. Faloun orders another clerk, Atal, to clean up the mess then escorts the newcomers to his office. Khirgan demands some of his fliers and, after Perrin shows Suroth's letter, they agree on four raken and twelve morat'raken. Faloun also happens to have a fine map of Altara that he gives them.</p>

<p>Camaille and Barmanes wait for Perrin outside. Now they head into town to get forkroot and a'dam. Balwer has not yet learned who rules Amadicia now that Ailron is dead. There are Hunters of the Horn in town. Perrin recalls that Moiraine had the Horn of Valere carried to the White Tower. A man notices Perrin's eyes and darts away. Khirgan leads them to a stone stable. Perrin and Khirgan enter. It is a forkroot manufactory. Using Suroth's letter they convince the Seanchan noble in charge to give them all the prepared forkroot, almost five thousand pounds. As they leave, Perrin turns in his saddle just as an arrow glances off his chest and pierces his arm. Mishima takes off for the men on top of a nearby building. Camaille and Barmanes remove the arrow and Khirgan apologizes for not protecting him better. Neald comes forward but Perrin tells him to wait till later. Khirgan is shocked that he would let someone use the One Power on him. Mishima returns. The men on the roof took poison and are already dead. Perrin thinks it might be the Forsaken. They head for an inn so Neald can Heal Perrin.</p>


<h2>Ch 13, Siege, Lion</h2>
<p><strong>Elayne.</strong> The siege is on! Do we trust this Lieutenant Chalz Guybon.. no. I don't. </p>

 <p>Elayne thinks she is not in danger because of Min's viewing that her babies will be born healthy. Birgitte orders the mercenaries to kill the fleeing attackers but they do not readily respond. The head of the mercenaries, Rhys a'Balaman, knows Aldin Miheres, who headed the attacking force. He explains that mercenaries will not pursue retreating foes because their positions may be reversed in the next battle. Mistress Harfor learned that Arymilla is trying to bribe some mercenaries. Elayne wishes she know how Mat, Thom and Olver are doing. She wishes she had Gareth Bryne but she knows Egwene needs him. A huge thunderstorm appears out of nowhere directly above the Inner City blocking view of the Royal Palace. Aviendha weaves Air, Fire, Water and Earth to slowly disperse the storm. Soon it is an ordinary rain. The Kin women open a gateway back to the main stableyard and everyone rides through. Several of the Kin have run away recently. Elayne thinks Nynaeve put too much backbone into them. In the stableyard another gateway is open and Queen's Guards ride through led by Lieutenant Charlz Guybon. Captain Kindlin in Aringill let him come to Caemlyn after Naean and the others escaped. He recruited men discharged by Gaebril and other loyal armsmen on the way, nearly ten thousand total. Mistress Zigane of the Kin found them and brought them by gateway. Elayne is delighted and promotes him to Captain. Birgitte makes him her second in command. They all go inside to dry off.</p>


<h2>Ch 14, Wet Things, Sea Folk (I want this as a tattoo lol)</h2>
<p><strong>Elayne.</strong> Elayne is still wet. uh, there are three mercenary captains waiting for Elayne, Mellar, Careane and Sareitha are with them - Elayne doesn't trust Mellar, and she also thinks Merilille, Careane, or Sareitha are Black Ajah. One sul'dam Marli Noichin can see the weaves, there are 28 more to go, Marli insists on being collard, Elayne wants to send the broken sul'dam back to SC. </p>

<p>They continue toward Elayne's quarters and then run into Chanelle din Seran White Shark and Renaile din Calon. They still wear mourning stoles for Nesta. They want to know about Talaan and Merilille. Elayne testily replies that every inn has been searched so they must have left Caemlyn. If the Windfinders do not return to their duties bringing in stores they will be breaking Zaida's bargain. Chanelle orders Renaile to go to The Silver Swan herself. There are nine sisters there at present. They would not tell Sareitha and Careane anything. Chanelle leaves to Travel to Tear. Once again Elayne heads for her apartments to dry off.</p>

<h2>Ch 15, A Different Skill, Aiel</h2>
<p><strong>Elayne.</strong> Whoa, this was cool! I can't beleive we are getting new things so late in the game, but I'm happy for it! So for some reason the cooridors are different to lead Elayne to her apartments.. Also, Avi is going back with Nadere and Dorindha back to the Wise One's on a secret mission.</p>

<p>In her apartments Essande, Sephanie Pelden and Naris await. Naris goes for food while Essande and Sephanie help them change. Aviendha has plenty of dresses, gifts from Tylin. When her pregnancy bothers her, Elayne sometimes regrets not drinking heartleaf tea before lying with Rand. Aviendha toys with the dull dagger ter'angreal. She thinks it prevents the Shadow from seeing the possessor, not the Eyeless or the Shadowtwisted, maybe not even Leafblighter. Aviendha cannot make ter'angreal but Elayne realizes she has a different Talent, identifying ter'angreal. THAT IS AWESOME! </p>

<p>They hurry to the sitting room where Elayne keeps the other ter'angreal from Ebou Dar, cups and bowls, statuettes and figurines, jewelry, all manner of things. Despite Min's viewing of her babies' safety, Elayne can no longer study them because of her poor grasp at the One Power. The ter'angreal are safe there as Reene Harfor has eliminated most of the dishonest servants. Aviendha examines other articles. The flexible black rod causes a controllable level of pain. The metal helmet controls some sort of machine. The ivory box holds music, hundreds of tunes. A flattish white bowl almost a pace across is for looking at things that are far away. A tall vase gathers water out of the air. A black-and-white figurine of a bird with long wings spread in flight is for talking to people a long way off. So is a blue figure of a woman as well as numerous rings, earrings and bracelets. A dull black rod is for cutting metal or stone. A glass figure of a man will chase away vermin. A root-like carving is for growing something like holes. It is activated by singing. A two foot statue holds thousands and thousands of books. Aviendha channels Fire and Earth into the figure and the Old Tongue words Ansoen and Imsoen, Lies and Truth, Fiction and Not Fiction, appear above it.</p>

<p>Nadere and Dorindha enter. They have come for Aviendha. The clan is leaving at the orders of the Car'a'carn to Bael. Aviendha hurriedly leaves to change clothes and pack. Naris arrives with food. Inspecting the meal, Nadere wants to know who is taking care of Elayne. Monaelle is Melaine's midwife. Essande offers that her niece Melfane is a midwife.</p>

<p>Elayne wants to choke Rand but all she knows of him is that he is somewhere far to the southeast. Aviendha returns in Aiel garb with a packed bundle and gives the dull dagger back to Elayne. Elayne gives Aviendha the amber turtle angreal and the twisted ring. She still has the seated woman and the silver ring, another dream ter'angreal that requires channeling Spirit. It was recovered from Ispan. Aviendha, Dorindha, and Nadere leave. Elayne goes to meet with the mercenaries.</p>

<h2>Ch 16, The New Follower, Darkfriend</h2>
<p><strong>Elayne.</strong> A cutpurse named Samwil Hark is going to follow Mellar, not after Elayne weaves Spirit and lays a Finder on his clothing and sends him away - only Elayne will be able to find him. Elayne is sure Mellar is a villain, she's had people follow Mellar and the first five have already died. She is certain Mellar was put in place to either spy on her or arrange her kidnapping and she is determined to get his master. She knows he faked the kidnap attempt that brought him to her attention Also, Dyelin is to meet Elayne in the Map Room.</p> 

<p>The mercenaries are Evard Cordwyn, Aldred Gomaisen, and Hafeen Bakuvun. Elayne sends Mellar away, clearly annoying him. Bakuvun acknowledges that he knew Mellar years ago. The mercenaries wish the Aes Sedai would leave; they have been badgering the mercenaries about the power of the White Tower. The mercenaries requested the audience because they have been losing men and want more money. Cordwyn pinches the maids. Elayne still needs them even with the men Guybon brought. Even so, Elayne angrily refuses to give in. Sareitha and Careane remind them that the White Tower will back Elayne over Arymilla. Elayne has a hard time believing one of them or Merilille is Black Ajah. The mercenaries leave and Elayne asks the Aes Sedai and Guardswomen to leave also. I'd also really like to trust Sareitha and Careane, but Elayne thinks against that.. I get it, people died lol.</p>


<h2>Ch 17, A Bronze Bear, Wheel and Snake (seeing this one a lot this book)</h2>
<p><strong>Elayne.</strong> I am really struggling with enjoying this plotline lol. I want to enjoy it so badly, but this has been such a slow build up I think someone important needs to die, or something drastic needs to happen. We are just farting around and very inconsequential things are happening.. ahhh. So the Palace corridors begin shifting and disappearing, causing unease in Caemlyn. An army of 200,000 Borderlanders and another of 60,000 unaffiliated Andorans approach the city. Yep.</p>

<p>Arymilla. Dinner occurs with Naean, Elenia, Nasin, Sylvase, Lir, and Karid. Jarid is High Seat of Sarand. Lir and Karind want to press with an all out attack. Arymilla wants to save her troops to fight the Borderlanders. All the food is spoling. Arymilla thinks Ellorien and possibly Aemlyn, Arathelle and Pelivar will side with her. She plans for Elayne and Dyelin to die. She thinks she can coerce Conail Northan and the other three children High Seats to publish support for her. If she cannot then Jaq Lounalt can. A servant bearing Marne's four Silver Moons enters with a message from Master Jakob Hernvil, Arymilla's secretary. Outside, he reports that "they have agreed, but they want all the gold up front." She orders him to draw up a letter to Mistress Andscale for her to sign. She orders him to tell them a week from tomorrow. In a week the throne will be hers. She goes back inside to tell the others the good news.</p>

<h2>Ch 18, News for the Dragon, Dragon</h2>
<p><strong>Rand.</strong> Well I'm happy. I do find it interesting about the madness and diziness in Rand's head. I wanted Rand to have an easy time channeling and embracing the Source but, it seems that's not the case. I guess I'll just have to wait and see. ALSO LOIAL IS GOING TO BE MARRIED, I love that. I love Loial. Also, I trust Logain. I don't trust Taim. Nynaeve says a storm is coming, could you say "a gathering storm"? Who is this blue eyed face with a square jaw Rand sees after their streams crossed at SL?? Also, I love that the Maidens are back with Rand, even though there are only 50. Also, I'm really interested to see how this all plays out with the SC. Mat has Tuon, Perrin is getting some SC behind him, and Rand is getting them too. This Last Battle thing is going to be pretty epic huh?</p> 

<p>Rand and Loial finish lunch at Lord Algarin's manor house. Lord Algarin left for the Black Tower. It is pouring rain. Loial continues to quiz Rand and take notes for his book. He is trying to grow a beard. He is disappointed because Rand does not elaborate on events like the fall of Illian and the cleansing of the True Source. Nynaeve and Alivia are there. Nynaeve still wears all of her jewelry set ter'angreal and her strange bracelet and rings angreal. Harilin of the Iron Mountain Taardad and Enaila of the Jarra Chareen stand guard. There are fifty Maidens at the manor house including some Shaido. Rand goes through the litany of women who died for him, Moiraine Damodred, Liah of the Cosaida Chareen, Sendara of the Iron Mountain Taardad, Lamelle of the Smoke Water Miagoma, Andhilin of the Red Salt Goshien, Desora of the Musara Reyn.</p>

<p>He wakes Min muttering the list at night. Lews Therin sometimes chants it. Min reads one of Herid Fel's books. With Min, Elayne and Aviendha bonded to him he wonders how to keep them safe. Verin and Cadsuane are there. Rand thinks of Mat and Perrin. He sees an image of Mat talking with a small, dark woman and leading a line of folks through forest.  He sees an image of Perrin with a man and woman in uniforms.  He can suppress the images if he wants. He is angry because he needs them and they are off for a day at the Ansaline Gardens.</p>

<p>Another image forms, the stranger who saved his life at Shadar Logoth when he fought Sammael. He and Lews Therin both think the man was aware of them as if they were touching.  Rand thinks their streams of balefire crossing created a link of some sort. He knows the other man used the True Power so he must be a Darkfriend but not one of the Forsaken as Lews Therin remembers all their faces.</p>

<p>Lews Therin moans about the voice in his head and Ilyena. He wants to die to join her. Lanfear and Ishamael knew how to track ta'veren by their effect on the Pattern.  No one else has found him that way since they died. Nynaeve delves Rand to make sure he is okay. Many servants are sick because of bad food. She has no more success Healing the wound in his side than Flinn. Ethin enters and announces that Lord Logain has returned.</p>

<p>Logain enters. He reports on the status of Caemlyn, the Borderlanders and the Black Tower. Arymilla still holds her siege on Elayne. Bashere has not returned yet. The Borderlanders have thirteen Aes Sedai with them. He does not know what they want but they have ties to the White Tower and Elaida certainly still wants him. Ethin leaves. Cadsuane helped capture both Logain and Taim. Logain was a minor noble in Ghealdan but King Johanin and the Crown High Council stripped him of his land and title when he became a false Dragon. Following Rand's orders Logain sent Asha'man to Arad Doman as well as Illian, more than half the Black Tower including all those with bonded Aes Sedai except for the ones with Rand.</p>

<p>Dobraine and Rhuarc will send a messenger as soon as they find someone in charge in Arad Doman. The Council of Merchants claim Alsalam is still King but no one can find him. Bandar Eban is in chaos. Rand will have to appoint a steward for Arad Doman but he does not know who. Taim is angry that Logain took so many men and that he does not know where Rand is. There are forty-one full Asha'man with Taim now and fifty more in his special classes. Min still sees an aura of glory around Logain. Rand cannot spend time worrying about Logain and Taim because he has to deal with the Seanchan and Tarmon Gai'don. Rand and Logain start arguing and Cadsuane tells them to be civil. Verin pipes up that the signs indicate the Last Battle is coming soon. Rand asks Cadsuane what she thinks of his plan. She thinks his peace with the Seanchan will be unpopular. He reminds her it is just a truce and only with the Dragon Reborn. When he is gone they can start their war again. Cadsuane is still doubtful. </p>

<p>Rand tells her one of his answers from the Aelfinn in the twisted red doorway. When he asked how he can win the Last Battle they answered: "The north and the east must be as one. The west and the south must be as one. The two must be as one." He actually asked how to win and survive. The last part of his answer was: "To live, you must die."</p>

<p>He thinks it means he should let the Seanchan hold the west and south and ally with them. She asks why he is reinforcing Illian and moving an army to Arad Doman. He wants armies in place to fight in case the Seanchan will not agree to a truce. Rand just figured out what the Prophecies of the Dragon meant with, "He must bind the Daughter of the Nine Moons to him." He expects Bashere to return soon with plans for their meeting. Cadsuane tells him he must be flexible rather than hard.</p>

<p>Ethin enters again and announces that three Ogier have arrived including Loial's mother Covril daughter of Ella daughter of Soong. The other two must be Elder Haman and Erith. Loial is distraught but Cadsuane tells him to go see her. They are in the Ogier sitting room upstairs. He is sure Erith will take him back to Stedding Tsofu so he will not be able to finish his book. Loial reluctantly leaves. Verin goes to find Tomas and Nynaeve goes to find Lan. The storm outside is letting up but Nynaeve says a terrible storm is coming.</p>

<h2>Ch 19, Vows, Trollocs! </h2>
<p><strong>Loial.</strong> I. LOVE. THIS. I love this so much. Loial is awesome, but he is sad he can't see the human ghosts and he has not yet seen any Ogier ghosts. Verin seems to know a lot about the recent events. He goes to the Ogier quaters, and thinks its strange Cadsuane knows his mother, Covril - Ella - Soong. Haman and Erith are there. Loil thinks Erith is beautiful. Covril and Haman are angry about their journey. Covril decided she must return to the Great Stump and they headed back to Shangtai. Erith tells Loial he was heroic in closing the Menetheren Gate and then rescuing Rand. Haman marries Loial and Erith on the spot. </p>

<p>Covril wants to leave immediately for Stedding Shangtai but Elder Haman insists on staying the night. The Great Stump is debating opening the Book of Translation which will take the Ogier to another world. Loial wishes he could address the Great Stump and argue that the Ogier should stay and fight the Shadow as they did in the Trolloc Wars. Loial looks out the windows and sees an army of Trollocs coming. He and Elder Haman pick up axes while Erith and Covril pick up long knives, then they go to warn Rand. I am VERY interested in this Book of Translation! And YES LOIAL GO LOIAL! Here we go... thousands of Trollocs! LET'S GO! </p>

<p><strong>Rand.</strong> HOLY MOLY. That was insane. Oh oh - Rand and Cadsuane both detect Shadowspawn. Also Bashere’s Saldaeans are trapped in the outbuildings - that’ll be important in a sec. The army of Trollocs are seen. Rand seizes saidin but when the dizziness hits him Lews Therin takes control. Rand then identifies the pins with some crazy names lol. LTT begs to see his hands… this was crazy! Then channels Earth, Air and Fire in Blossoms of Fire. He weaves Spirit touched with Fire for a gateway but then adds touches of Earth for Deathgates. Apparently - Traveling kills Shadowspawn, that’s going to be important. This, I believe is going to be an incredibly important weave Rand and Logain and some Asha’man just learned. Rand raises his hands so he can see them and Lews Therin weaves Fire and Earth for Arrows of Fire. The Trollocs try to break into the outbuildings and some are on fire.</p>

<p>Logain quenches some of the fires. Lews Therin is focused only on killing. Eventually all the Trollocs are dead. Harilin, Enaila and Min are still ready to fight. </p>

<p>Logain releases saidin and asks why Rand did not teach him the fancy weaves sooner. Is he playing favorites like Taim? Lews Therin will not release saidin, moaning that he wants to join Ilyena. Lews Therin remembers dying and starts to draw too much saidin. </p>

<p>Logain takes note and everyone is worried. Cadsuane grills Min on how Rand is feeling because she knows of their bond. Rand warns Cadsuane not to threaten Min again. Rand tells Lews Therin that they can die together at Tarmon Gai'don and he reluctantly releases. Cadsuane knows even before Logain tells her. </p>


<h2>Ch 20, The Golden Crane, Ravens</h2>
<p><strong>Rand.</strong> Yep, I like this book. Logain says Gabrelle and Toveine have worn themselves out. The fewer than twelve Asha'man and fewer than twenty Aes Sedai are working to incinerate the thousands of corpses. They think the Trollocs came from the Spine of the World through the Waygate at Stedding Shangtai. The Aes Sedai refuse to teach new weaves to Alivia but she is still learning fast just by watching. Rand thinks someone knows Ishamael's trick of tracking ta'veren, or maybe the blue-eyed man can locate him. The True Source is now clean, but with the wounds in his side from Ishamael and Padan Fain Rand wonders if he is. A serving man even older than Ethin brings Rand a letter from Verin. The nineteen dead Saldaeans are laid out in a barn; they do not bury their dead in the rain. Suddenly they are covered in flies. Alivia weaves and they all fly out the door. Cadsuane notes that she learns fast. Min thinks she had viewings about Moiraine that were wrong because she is dead. Rand reads Verin's letter. She left taking Tomas with her. She says to trust Cadsuane and heed her advice, but be wary of everyone else.</p>

<p>Loial and Elder Haman come outside. Loial says he married Erith and Rand congratulates him. Loial promises that he will be there for Rand at Tarmon Gai'don. Rand sealed the Waygates at Caemlyn, Cairhien, Illian and Tear. He put a trap on the open one near Fal Dara. He could not find the one near Far Madding. He needs Loial now to locate the others. Elder Haman insists that Loial must return to Stedding Shangtai to speak at the Great Stump but he volunteers to take up the task himself. Rand says he will take them to Stedding Shangtai the next morning.</p>

<p>Elza Penfell arrives with Davram Bashere. Two of the dead Saldaeans are Kirkun and Ahzkan. Bashere and Karldin Manfor met with High Lady Suroth. They were not allowed to talk with anyone else. The Daughter of the Nine Moons will meet with Rand at a manor house in northern Altara. She will bring six sul'dam and damane and no one else. Rand can bring five other channelers and one other woman to make the numbers even.</p>

<p><strong>Nynaeve.</strong> Whatcha doin Nynaeve? What’s at World’s End? Is she just trying to protect Lan?? </p>

<p>Nynaeve is resting from channeling too much. She took willow bark for her headache. She always wears the bracelet and rings angreal and the jewelry set ter'angreal. One of her rings with a pale green stone detects saidar and saidin. Another with a flawless sapphire turns cold when someone nearby is hostile or angry. Lan is there. It still grates on her that Myrelle holds his bond. </p>

<p>She avoids the other Aes Sedai because they supported Elaida. They are linked in pairs using saidar and saidin Fire to incinerate corpses. Lan is angry that Rand is negotiating with the Seanchan instead of convincing King Easar to return to guarding the Blight. The Last Battle will be there and at Shayol Ghul. In the Trolloc Wars the Shadow used Tarwin's Gap to move large armies of Trollocs. Nynaeve offers to take him to the Borderlands but first makes him swear to ride to Fal Moran before he enters the Blight and to allow anyone who wishes to ride with him. He agrees. In the stables they mount Mandarb and Loversknot.</p>

<p>Outside she weaves a gateway and they lead the horses through. Lan realizes they are not in Shienar. They are at World's End, in Saldaea as far from Fal Moran as possible. Nynaeve reminds him of his oath, hurriedly rides through a new gateway and lets it close.</p> 

<p><strong>Weilin Aldragoran.</strong> Chills. I have chills.. could be that it's just cold in here, but WHOA! "THE GOLDEN CRANE FLIES FOR TARMON GAI'DON! THE GOLDEN CRANE FLIES FOR TARMON GAI'DON!" So good. This was a neat perspective, I was like who is this Aldragoran fella, and then.. BOOM! Weilin Aldragoran deals jewels and wears the hadori of his Malkier heritage even though he lived almost his whole life in Saldaea, his wife Alida is Saldaean. Managan and Gorenellin are also jewel merchants of Malkier heritage, but they don't wear the hadori. Nynaeve shows up, what a boss,and she is young and wearing her red ki'sain, he thinks few Malkier go to the WT since the AS failed Malkier. She wants him to send messages to other merchants with pigeons that the Last Battle is coming. She shows him Lan's ring and names herself Nynaeve ti al'Meara Mandragoran - Lan Mandragoran rides from World's End toward Tarwin's Gap, toward Tarmon Gai'don and will he ride alone? Aldragoran swears he will ride with Lan and Managan and Gorenellin join shouting "the Golden Crane flies for Tarmon Gai'don!!"</p>
