    <p>Done. Wow. I cried. I laughed. I am amazed. This book is spectacular. This world is gigantic. I’m so excited for more Stormlight Archive! And more and more and more Brandon Sanderson!</p>

        <h2>Written Review</h2>
        <p>** spoiler alert ** A little preamble for how I write my reviews: I make notes at each page I stop at, for more of a reminder or just awesome things that I’ve read.</p>
        
        <p>Here is my review of The Way of Kings! Started Reading 04.09.22</p>

        <p>130. I don’t have particular words to describe the fun I’m having with this book, so far. I’ve built up so much hype for myself, around this book, that it’s amazing to read it finally. I’m really enthralled with these characters so far. The story is fun and exciting, and I can’t wait to read more.</p>
        
        <p>196. An enticing story as Part One comes to a close. Very good so far. The story is seeming to be propelled by both character and world. I’m very impressed with Sanderson’s writing. As always, I look forward to reading more!</p>
        
        <p>275. Kalidan is using Stormlight from the spheres, but I have no idea how! And HE doesn’t know it yet!</p>
        
        <p>525. Kalidan is most certainly taking in Stormlight from the spheres. Also, was that the Stormfather?! Also, what is going on with Shallan and these “people” in her drawings. Dalinar is abdicating, wow. We are building to something huge!</p>
        
        <p>1007. Done. Wow. I cried. I laughed. I am amazed. This book is spectacular. This world is gigantic. I’m so excited for more Stormlight Archive! And more and more and more Brandon Sanderson!</p>
