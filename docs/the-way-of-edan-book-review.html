<blockquote>Iâ€™m Currently Reading The Way of Edan by @PhilipChaseTheBestofFantasy ! #currentlyreading</blockquote>

<h2>Spoilers</h2>
<p>As I'm reading, I have been taking notes but here are my thoughts so far.</p>

<details>
    <summary>Thoughts as of 32% - page 146</summary>
    <p>Wow, I am thoroughly impressed so far. It is heavy on the names and worldbuilding and the prose is dense.. but beautiful and impactful and stunning. You don't get where you are without the writing. I mean, you might struggle a bit but it is worth it. The beginning of the book hooked me instantly. I was flabbergasted by the eloquence at which Dr. Philip Chase writes. The way the world works, the history, the descriptions of the locations, the NAMES. AMAZING. It's tough sometimes, I am taking notes as I read and it is well worth it so far. </p>

<p>This is, so far, my biggest surprise read of the year. I've only followed Dr. Philip Chase for a couple months now, I've heard his name throughout book-tube and I've heard of this book and trilogy of The Edan Trilogy, and now to read it; I am BLOWN AWAY. </p>

<p>The start of this story is exactly what I needed. I had been reading some Stephen King, and I love fantasy and I've been missing some classical / high / epic fantasy and THIS IS IT! I'm excited to read more certainly! </p>

<p>A huge recommended read from me!</p>

<h2>Who is Philip Chase?</h2>
<p>This is something I'm really excited about. I've been following <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PhilipChaseTheBestofFantasy" target="_blank"> Chase on YouTube</a> lately and he has put out a new fantasy trilogy of novels!</p>

<h2>Philip Chase in Review</h2>
