    <summary>Notes as I Read</summary>
    <h2>Header</h2>
    <p>"And it shall come to pass, in the days when the Dark Hunt rides, when the right hand falters and the left hand strays, that mankind shall come to the Crossroads of Twilight and all that is, all that was, and all that will be shall balance on the point of a sword, while the winds of the Shadow grow. —from The Prophecies of the Dragon translation believed done by Jain Charin, known as Jain Farstrider, shortly before his disappearance"</p>

    <h2>Prologue, Glimmers of the Pattern, Wheel and Snake</h2>
    <p><strong>Rodel Ituralde.</strong> Rodel is the Wolf, not Perrin, but is known as the Wolf. He is in Arad Doman riding Dart, with twenty armsmen. He has an officer named Jaalam Nishur with them. Rodel has been working to save Arad Doman from being overrun by Dragonsworn. Many nobles formerly loyal to the King have now switched sides, since King Alsalam went into hiding after his orders seemed intent on causing chaos.... DAMANDRED IS KING ALSALAM?!!? The orders move his army around searching for a Dragonsworn army that is never found. Other orders to nobles Machir, Teacal, and Rahman have led to battles with his own men. Ituralde has Solanje, Maseen, Lake Somal, and Kandelmar. The Lords of Katar do not sell to Dragonsworn anymore, a Gray Man killed Lady Tuva trying to stop his last orders. No one is sure of Alsalam's location, but he is not in Bandar Eban. Donjel, a scout, rides up and says the meeting Ituralde arrounged at the Lady Osana's hunting lodge with leaders of the Dragonsworn is ready. However, Osana vanished some time ago, was that Graendal? WHOA, MAYBE! Donjel takes a letter from Ituralde to give to his wife Tamsin Ituralde in case he doesn't make it to Coron Ford. Ituralde and his men meet with Lord Shimron, Domani Lords Rajabi, Wakeda, and Ankaer. There is also a Tarabon in a seperate group. Ituralde announces the SC have moved into the ALmoth Plain and he means to stop them! Alsalam's latest orders are to attack the SC. Ituralde offers a truce to help defend Arad Doman, he will send the Tarabon back home to retake their homeland and he will accompany him. He has a secret plan.. uh oh. </p>

    <p><strong>Eamon Valda.</strong> Lord-Captain Commander Eamon Valda is in the Whitecloak camp in the northern Amadicia, there are 9,000 Whitecloaks. It's been a month since the SC took Amador. King Ailron was killed in the battle with the SC at Jeramel. There is a terrible odor, but it disappears quickly.. hmm. He meets with Asunama to talk him into meeting the rest of the Council - the surviving ten Lord Captains. There are rumors of an Andoran army in Murandy. Valda is furious that Morgase escaped or was killed and now Galad is no longer useful. Asunawa wants to go after the AS in Murandy, but he finally agrees to meet with the Council - they will ride tonight! </p>

    <p><strong>Gabrelle.</strong> Gabrelle (one of Logain's bonded Reds), with Toveine, and Logain are riding in the woods near the BT. Two weeks have gone by since they were captured. Desandre and Lemai ordered all the sisters to be coridal with their captors in hopes of getting on their good side. Gabrelle sees a strange bird.. hmm. The bonding feeling is new to Gabrelle, she is Red and never had a Warder. There is increasing tension between Logain and Taim's factions. Atal Mishraile rides up bringing a message that the M'Hael has granted Logain's request to go recruiting. Logain announces that he must return to make preparations, TOv and Gab are determined to go with him. - - Ahhhh, I so want to see a man who can channel feel the clean source.. CAN'T WAIT!</p>

    <p><strong>Yukiri.</strong> Aes Sedai Black Ajah plots.. we must sus out the BA! Yukiri and Midanai (grays) walk in the WT. There are only about 200 sisters in the WT. Meidani's Warder is Leonin. Meidani is one of the rebl moles. Saerin and Pevara decided to keep them scret until their usefulness runs out. There is still no news of Coiren and the embassy to Rand. Yukiri fears for her life. She is now sure Tamra Ospenya (Amyrlin) didn't die naturally. They run into three Browns, Marris Thornhill, Doraise Mesianos and Elin Warrel. Elaida seems fiercer than ever since her private penance with Silviana. They pass a pair of Yellow sisters, Pritalle Nerbaijan with her Warder and Atuan Larisett. She is Black Ajah. Talene exposed the other two of her circle, Galina Casban and Temaile Kinderode, and her outside contact Atuan. Yukiri hopes Atuan will lead them to the other two of her circle. Three sisters were murdered at the time Temaile disappeared and others disappeared with her. The two Yellow rebel moles, Celestin and Annharid, are trying to learn about Atuan's friends. Alviarin left yesterday or the day before. Yukiri orders Meidani to take this opportunity to renew her novice friendship with Elaida. Siuan was Elaida's protégée when they were novice and Accepted. They pass a tapestry depicting the humbling of Queen Rhiannon. Seaine shows up with Bernaile Gelbarn. It has been almost two months since Elaida came to Seaine, nearly two weeks since Yukiri found Seaine and Pevara. They discuss the mystery of the heads of the Ajahs secretly meeting. After the rebels left, the Ajah heads apparently handpicked the new Sitters. Serancha personally chose Andaya for the Gray. Juilaine was chosen for the Brown Ajah. Suana was chosen for the Yellow Ajah. Ferane left the White Sitters less than ten years ago, but was re-selected. Adelorna handpicked Rina for the Green. Talene told them Adelorna was head of the Green Ajah. There are two new Browns, Shevan being the other. The Brown was the only Ajah to have two Sitters join the rebels.</p>

    <p><strong>Gawyn.</strong> Hey Gawyn! Gawyn is in Dorlan east of TV. An army appeared out of nowhere and now surrounds TV (EGWENE AND CREW). Rajar says an AS has arrived from the WT. Gawyn, Rojar, Tomil are at the Mayor's house. Garon Burlow is the Mayor. Katerine and Tarna are there and have taken over the house. Tarna arrived the day the army appeared, Tarna also displaced Lusonia COle from her room and took command of the eleven other sisters from Covarla Baldene. She is trying to get to TV. Katerine arrived yesterday, and took command from Tarna. Narenwin arrives with orders for Gawyn from the Amyrlin (he doesn't know which Amyrlin). Narenwin was sent to take charge, she escaped TV on a fishing boat. Katerine and Tarna are trying to get to TV and they will leave in the monring to go to TV.</p>

    <p><strong>Davram.</strong> Man, I love Davram Bashere, he's awesome! Davram is riding Quick a league north of Caemlyn. He is with Bael, Tumad, and an escort of Aiel and Saldaeans. They are scouting the armies that have arrived and are laying siege to Caemlyn. A mile south, five thousand of them are setting up campt on the TV Road, Bashere is looking through a looking glass from Kin Tovere!! Armaghn and Raened are loyal to Naean Arawan. Mara and Ankarin and Talken are loyal to Elenia. Both are now backing Arymilla Marne.. yuck boring lol. Bael says they should take out the beseigers but Elayne told Melaine to tell him to do nothing. Bashere thinks about Tenobia, Ethenielle, Paitar, and Easar fifty leagues north. Bashere goes back to his camp to find it surrounded at his tent. Deira was attacked when she caught two men ransacking their tent. One of her laidies is Zavion, Lady of Gahaur. Tumad reports the ransackers were found dead. Bashere tells Tumad to find the man who came to him yesterday and tell him that Bashere agrees. </p>

    <p><strong>Samitsu.</strong> Alright, good one RJ. Master Underhill, is that Andoran? HA! Take a shot for the LOTR reference! Okay, this was a great perspective. Dobraine was attacked, Loial and Karldin are back, a servant Cera Doinal says she says Maringil's ghost - SLAYER/ISAM/LUC?! WHAT?!, Rosara Medrano comes with news that Logain has arrived with other Asha'man and Aes Sedai, and 31 sisters including 5 Reds have sworn to Rand. </p>

    <h2>Ch 1, Time to Be Gone, Dice</h2>
    <p><strong>Mat.</strong> A wind rises in Rhannon Hills and blows northwest across the harbor of Ebou Dar and the mouth of the Eldar River. RJ is spoon-feeding us that Noal is Jain Farstrider... I think lol. This crew is camping near the Great North Road north of the Circuit of Heaven. Many Seanchan ships are destroyed by the Windfinders and hudnres of SF are killed or captured and later hung, Mat thinks they left early. A good start to COT!</p>

    <h2>Ch 2, Two Captains, Elephant</h2>
    <p><strong>Mat.</strong> Cool, Mat's dice are rattling again. This crew will be leaving when Thom returns. Will Thom return?! We'll see. Mat, Egeanin, and Noal return to Valan Luca's circus. Petra, the strongman, and his wife, Clarine watch a horse handler named Col roll dice. Some SC soldiers are questioning Luca. Rumann, the swordjuggler is courting Adria the contortionist. Aludra is hard at work. Bayle Domon and Blaeric Negina watch the soldiers with Luca. The soldiers leave and Egeanin avoids them as one of them was on her ship Fearless on the trip to Falme. Luca says the soldiers wanted his horses, but he still has High Lady Suroth's warrant. Mat says they can leave as soon as Thom returns. Luca is married to Latelle! The one Nynaeve punched.. right? lol. There are three AS and three SD in one wagon, ouch. Juilin, Thera (AMATHERA THE PANARCH OF TARABON! WOW!), and Olver are together. Noal shows up then leaves to tell Vanin and the Redarms. Noal shares a tent with Thom, Nerim, and Lopin.</p> 

    <h2>Ch 3, A Fan of Colors, A'dam</h2>
    <p><strong>Mat.</strong> Oh yes, I like this book! Only 3 chapters in.. but I like this book! Great to start off with Mat! Alright.. Mat goes to Tuon's wagon, Tuon insists on calling Mat Toy. Mat asks Tuon's age and she is Nineteen. She asks about his ring, and then asks if Mat remembers Hawkwing's face, Sulcia stares at him waiting.. Mat remembers Hawkwing defeating Culain in Aldeshar, but he lies and says no. Then she asks about his ashandarei, they shake hands to seal the bargain of helping each other and the dice stop - the third time in her presense. Thom comes in and says Tylin was murdered and Beslan will be crowned soon. Mat thinks it was the gholam. Tuon doesn't know what that is. Blaeric summons Mat to Joline.. I love Tuon being jealous lol. Joline, Teslyn, and Edesnia are in the wagon with Bethamin, Renna, and Seta. The crew planned to go to Lugard, but Joline says to go to Illian instead because of the amount of channeling that is happening far away... RAND AND NYNAEVE! When Mat thinks of Rand, colors swirl and can almost see an image of a man and a woman facing each other and knows the channeling is Rand.. so cool. So, the memories in Mat's head... I want to learn more about that! Hopefully we get more of that. The colors swirling... I want to learn more about that too! </p>

    <h2>Ch 4, The Tale of a Doll, Seanchan</h2>
    <p><strong>Furyk Karede.</strong> Oh yeah, this is good. This was an awesome chapter. Karede is in his room in The Wandering Woman with his servant Ajimbura. He is wearing his Imperial Green robe (people think it's black). There are a lot of rats around. Ajimbura is a tribesman from Kaensada, a barely civilized part of the empire. Karede has been promoted to banner-general for his limited sucess against the Asha'man. They're still worried about that unweaving weapon. Tuon vanished nine days ago. He wonders if she fell victim to the Lady of the Shadows. Captain Musenge commands her personal bodyguard. The Seeker enters and Kadere covers the map of TV he has been studying, that is part of Lord Yulan's plans. The Seeker's name is Almurat Mor. This is awesome. His last name indicates he is ancestors to Luthair Paendrag. Someone has started a rumor that a girl who looks like Tuon was extorting gold and jewelry from merchants. Anath is in seclution, Suroth is destraught. The Seeker knows a lot about Kared - he is 42, was born the property of Jalid Magonine in Ancarid. He distinguished himself at the Muyami Uprising and the Jianmin Incident. He served as bodyguard to the Empress until chosen to accompany Turak and the Hailene. He served as bodyguard to Tuo and kept a doll of hers named Emela for ten years until it was lost in a fire at Sohima. He has two living sons in the DG, his wife Kalia is dead. The Seeker tells him that on the same night as Tylin's death and Tuon's disappearance two damane disappeared as well as Tylin's pet, Thom and some soldiers. For some reason the Mor is super fixated on Thom. Lady Egeanin Tamarath took the damane. The Seeker suspects AS took Tuon and that Suroth is in with the AS. When Egeanin left the city gates she was heading north and Jehannah was mentioned at the palace stables. The Seeker thinks those are misdirects. The Seeker leaves and Karede calls Ajimbura and sends him with a message to Captain Musenge. They go to the Rahad and he rides up the Illian rode on his horse Aldazar. He meets Ajimbura who leads him to Captain Musenge and 100 DG and 20 Ogier Gardeners, the First Gardener is Hartha. 6 damane and sul'dam including Melitene, Tuon's personal der'sul'dam. One of the damane is Mylin. They set out to hunt down Tuon's kidnappers. </p>

    <h2>Ch 5, The Forging of a Hammer, Wolf</h2>
    <p><strong>Perrin.</strong> Alright, it's Perrin. We still haven't found Faile. Also, Selande brings news that Masema sent another rider back toward Amadicia, Masema has new supplies and followers gathered in Altara, and Masema has over 10,000 followers, and Masuri and Rovair have been meeting with Masema, also Annoura comes sometimes. Also, in the wolf dream, Perrin smells a scent worse than a Neverborn (Fade). He knows it means death, but he follows it anyway. Perrin also talks to the wolves and they don't answer him and they say "the Last Hunt is coming". Yep, that's all I caught. lol.</p>

    <h2>Ch 6, The Scent of a Dream, Wheel and Snake</h2>
    <p><strong>Perrin.</strong> Perrin smells the scent from his dream, it is DARKHOUNDS. Perrin remembers that Moiraine used balefire to stop the Darkhound in Illian. The trail circles the camp and headed south. Berelain brings Perrin a basket with breakfast and a note that Gendar and Santes stole from Masema's desk it says that the bearer is under the personal protection of HL Suroth Sabelle Meldarath of Asinbayar and Barsabba. Annoura advised destroying the note, Perrin keeps it. Perrin tells Berelain about Annoura and Masuri meeting Masema and Berelain says she'll look into it. Perrin shows everyone the Darkhound tracks. </p>

    <h2>Ch 7, Blacksmith's Puzzle, Ravens</h2>
    <p><strong>Perrin.</strong> Masuri inspects the DH tracks, and she is an EXPERT. She studied traces of seven different packs. Many believe there are few packs, seven, nine or thirteen. During the Trolloc Wars, Sorelana Alsahhan wrote that there were a hundred packs. Earlier, Ivonell Bharatiya wrote of 'numbers like unto the nightmares of mankind.' This is a new pack. It is huge, maybe fifty, instead of the normal ten or twelve. There is also a sense of urgency in the trace. WHOA! I bet there are probably the 100 packs and we'll see them at the Last Battle! Mark it.. ch 7 of COT > whatever chapter of whatever book is the last battle, we will count 100 packs of Darkhounds.</p>

    <p>Masema comes and tels them about a large town, So Harbor, that has large stores of food, Perrin thinks Masema is trying to delay freeing Faile. Arganda arrives with support bringing the numbers to Perrin's favor against Masema, and Masema and his men ride off. Arganda starts towards Perrin but changes direction when he sees two of the scouts returning from the east. </p>
