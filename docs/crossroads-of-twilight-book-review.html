    <summary>Notes as I Read</summary>
    <h2>Header</h2>
    <p>"And it shall come to pass, in the days when the Dark Hunt rides, when the right hand falters and the left hand strays, that mankind shall come to the Crossroads of Twilight and all that is, all that was, and all that will be shall balance on the point of a sword, while the winds of the Shadow grow. —from The Prophecies of the Dragon translation believed done by Jain Charin, known as Jain Farstrider, shortly before his disappearance"</p>

    <h2>Prologue, Glimmers of the Pattern, Wheel and Snake</h2>
    <p><strong>Rodel Ituralde.</strong> Rodel is the Wolf, not Perrin, but is known as the Wolf. He is in Arad Doman riding Dart, with twenty armsmen. He has an officer named Jaalam Nishur with them. Rodel has been working to save Arad Doman from being overrun by Dragonsworn. Many nobles formerly loyal to the King have now switched sides, since King Alsalam went into hiding after his orders seemed intent on causing chaos.... DAMANDRED IS KING ALSALAM?!!? The orders move his army around searching for a Dragonsworn army that is never found. Other orders to nobles Machir, Teacal, and Rahman have led to battles with his own men. Ituralde has Solanje, Maseen, Lake Somal, and Kandelmar. The Lords of Katar do not sell to Dragonsworn anymore, a Gray Man killed Lady Tuva trying to stop his last orders. No one is sure of Alsalam's location, but he is not in Bandar Eban. Donjel, a scout, rides up and says the meeting Ituralde arrounged at the Lady Osana's hunting lodge with leaders of the Dragonsworn is ready. However, Osana vanished some time ago, was that Graendal? WHOA, MAYBE! Donjel takes a letter from Ituralde to give to his wife Tamsin Ituralde in case he doesn't make it to Coron Ford. Ituralde and his men meet with Lord Shimron, Domani Lords Rajabi, Wakeda, and Ankaer. There is also a Tarabon in a seperate group. Ituralde announces the SC have moved into the ALmoth Plain and he means to stop them! Alsalam's latest orders are to attack the SC. Ituralde offers a truce to help defend Arad Doman, he will send the Tarabon back home to retake their homeland and he will accompany him. He has a secret plan.. uh oh. </p>

    <p><strong>Eamon Valda.</strong> Lord-Captain Commander Eamon Valda is in the Whitecloak camp in the northern Amadicia, there are 9,000 Whitecloaks. It's been a month since the SC took Amador. King Ailron was killed in the battle with the SC at Jeramel. There is a terrible odor, but it disappears quickly.. hmm. He meets with Asunama to talk him into meeting the rest of the Council - the surviving ten Lord Captains. There are rumors of an Andoran army in Murandy. Valda is furious that Morgase escaped or was killed and now Galad is no longer useful. Asunawa wants to go after the AS in Murandy, but he finally agrees to meet with the Council - they will ride tonight! </p>

    <p><strong>Gabrelle.</strong> Gabrelle (one of Logain's bonded Reds), with Toveine, and Logain are riding in the woods near the BT. Two weeks have gone by since they were captured. Desandre and Lemai ordered all the sisters to be coridal with their captors in hopes of getting on their good side. Gabrelle sees a strange bird.. hmm. The bonding feeling is new to Gabrelle, she is Red and never had a Warder. There is increasing tension between Logain and Taim's factions. Atal Mishraile rides up bringing a message that the M'Hael has granted Logain's request to go recruiting. Logain announces that he must return to make preparations, TOv and Gab are determined to go with him. - - Ahhhh, I so want to see a man who can channel feel the clean source.. CAN'T WAIT!</p>

    <p><strong>Yukiri.</strong> Aes Sedai Black Ajah plots.. we must sus out the BA! Yukiri and Midanai (grays) walk in the WT. There are only about 200 sisters in the WT. Meidani's Warder is Leonin. Meidani is one of the rebl moles. Saerin and Pevara decided to keep them scret until their usefulness runs out. There is still no news of Coiren and the embassy to Rand. Yukiri fears for her life. She is now sure Tamra Ospenya (Amyrlin) didn't die naturally. They run into three Browns, Marris Thornhill, Doraise Mesianos and Elin Warrel. Elaida seems fiercer than ever since her private penance with Silviana. They pass a pair of Yellow sisters, Pritalle Nerbaijan with her Warder and Atuan Larisett. She is Black Ajah. Talene exposed the other two of her circle, Galina Casban and Temaile Kinderode, and her outside contact Atuan. Yukiri hopes Atuan will lead them to the other two of her circle. Three sisters were murdered at the time Temaile disappeared and others disappeared with her. The two Yellow rebel moles, Celestin and Annharid, are trying to learn about Atuan's friends. Alviarin left yesterday or the day before. Yukiri orders Meidani to take this opportunity to renew her novice friendship with Elaida. Siuan was Elaida's protégée when they were novice and Accepted. They pass a tapestry depicting the humbling of Queen Rhiannon. Seaine shows up with Bernaile Gelbarn. It has been almost two months since Elaida came to Seaine, nearly two weeks since Yukiri found Seaine and Pevara. They discuss the mystery of the heads of the Ajahs secretly meeting. After the rebels left, the Ajah heads apparently handpicked the new Sitters. Serancha personally chose Andaya for the Gray. Juilaine was chosen for the Brown Ajah. Suana was chosen for the Yellow Ajah. Ferane left the White Sitters less than ten years ago, but was re-selected. Adelorna handpicked Rina for the Green. Talene told them Adelorna was head of the Green Ajah. There are two new Browns, Shevan being the other. The Brown was the only Ajah to have two Sitters join the rebels.</p>

    <p><strong>Gawyn.</strong> Hey Gawyn! Gawyn is in Dorlan east of TV. An army appeared out of nowhere and now surrounds TV (EGWENE AND CREW). Rajar says an AS has arrived from the WT. Gawyn, Rojar, Tomil are at the Mayor's house. Garon Burlow is the Mayor. Katerine and Tarna are there and have taken over the house. Tarna arrived the day the army appeared, Tarna also displaced Lusonia COle from her room and took command of the eleven other sisters from Covarla Baldene. She is trying to get to TV. Katerine arrived yesterday, and took command from Tarna. Narenwin arrives with orders for Gawyn from the Amyrlin (he doesn't know which Amyrlin). Narenwin was sent to take charge, she escaped TV on a fishing boat. Katerine and Tarna are trying to get to TV and they will leave in the monring to go to TV.</p>

    <p><strong>Davram.</strong> Man, I love Davram Bashere, he's awesome! Davram is riding Quick a league north of Caemlyn. He is with Bael, Tumad, and an escort of Aiel and Saldaeans. They are scouting the armies that have arrived and are laying siege to Caemlyn. A mile south, five thousand of them are setting up campt on the TV Road, Bashere is looking through a looking glass from Kin Tovere!! Armaghn and Raened are loyal to Naean Arawan. Mara and Ankarin and Talken are loyal to Elenia. Both are now backing Arymilla Marne.. yuck boring lol. Bael says they should take out the beseigers but Elayne told Melaine to tell him to do nothing. Bashere thinks about Tenobia, Ethenielle, Paitar, and Easar fifty leagues north. Bashere goes back to his camp to find it surrounded at his tent. Deira was attacked when she caught two men ransacking their tent. One of her laidies is Zavion, Lady of Gahaur. Tumad reports the ransackers were found dead. Bashere tells Tumad to find the man who came to him yesterday and tell him that Bashere agrees. </p>

    <p><strong>Samitsu.</strong> Alright, good one RJ. Master Underhill, is that Andoran? HA! Take a shot for the LOTR reference! Okay, this was a great perspective. Dobraine was attacked, Loial and Karldin are back, a servant Cera Doinal says she says Maringil's ghost - SLAYER/ISAM/LUC?! WHAT?!, Rosara Medrano comes with news that Logain has arrived with other Asha'man and Aes Sedai, and 31 sisters including 5 Reds have sworn to Rand. </p>

    <h2>Ch 1, Time to Be Gone, Dice</h2>
    <p><strong>Mat.</strong> A wind rises in Rhannon Hills and blows northwest across the harbor of Ebou Dar and the mouth of the Eldar River. RJ is spoon-feeding us that Noal is Jain Farstrider... I think lol. This crew is camping near the Great North Road north of the Circuit of Heaven. Many Seanchan ships are destroyed by the Windfinders and hudnres of SF are killed or captured and later hung, Mat thinks they left early. A good start to COT!</p>

    <h2>Ch 2, Two Captains, Elephant</h2>
    <p><strong>Mat.</strong> Cool, Mat's dice are rattling again. This crew will be leaving when Thom returns. Will Thom return?! We'll see. Mat, Egeanin, and Noal return to Valan Luca's circus. Petra, the strongman, and his wife, Clarine watch a horse handler named Col roll dice. Some SC soldiers are questioning Luca. Rumann, the swordjuggler is courting Adria the contortionist. Aludra is hard at work. Bayle Domon and Blaeric Negina watch the soldiers with Luca. The soldiers leave and Egeanin avoids them as one of them was on her ship Fearless on the trip to Falme. Luca says the soldiers wanted his horses, but he still has High Lady Suroth's warrant. Mat says they can leave as soon as Thom returns. Luca is married to Latelle! The one Nynaeve punched.. right? lol. There are three AS and three SD in one wagon, ouch. Juilin, Thera (AMATHERA THE PANARCH OF TARABON! WOW!), and Olver are together. Noal shows up then leaves to tell Vanin and the Redarms. Noal shares a tent with Thom, Nerim, and Lopin.</p> 

    <h2>Ch 3, A Fan of Colors, A'dam</h2>
    <p><strong>Mat.</strong> Oh yes, I like this book! Only 3 chapters in.. but I like this book! Great to start off with Mat! Alright.. Mat goes to Tuon's wagon, Tuon insists on calling Mat Toy. Mat asks Tuon's age and she is Nineteen. She asks about his ring, and then asks if Mat remembers Hawkwing's face, Sulcia stares at him waiting.. Mat remembers Hawkwing defeating Culain in Aldeshar, but he lies and says no. Then she asks about his ashandarei, they shake hands to seal the bargain of helping each other and the dice stop - the third time in her presense. Thom comes in and says Tylin was murdered and Beslan will be crowned soon. Mat thinks it was the gholam. Tuon doesn't know what that is. Blaeric summons Mat to Joline.. I love Tuon being jealous lol. Joline, Teslyn, and Edesnia are in the wagon with Bethamin, Renna, and Seta. The crew planned to go to Lugard, but Joline says to go to Illian instead because of the amount of channeling that is happening far away... RAND AND NYNAEVE! When Mat thinks of Rand, colors swirl and can almost see an image of a man and a woman facing each other and knows the channeling is Rand.. so cool. So, the memories in Mat's head... I want to learn more about that! Hopefully we get more of that. The colors swirling... I want to learn more about that too! </p>

    <h2>Ch 4, The Tale of a Doll, Seanchan</h2>
    <p><strong>Furyk Karede.</strong> Oh yeah, this is good. This was an awesome chapter. Karede is in his room in The Wandering Woman with his servant Ajimbura. He is wearing his Imperial Green robe (people think it's black). There are a lot of rats around. Ajimbura is a tribesman from Kaensada, a barely civilized part of the empire. Karede has been promoted to banner-general for his limited sucess against the Asha'man. They're still worried about that unweaving weapon. Tuon vanished nine days ago. He wonders if she fell victim to the Lady of the Shadows. Captain Musenge commands her personal bodyguard. The Seeker enters and Kadere covers the map of TV he has been studying, that is part of Lord Yulan's plans. The Seeker's name is Almurat Mor. This is awesome. His last name indicates he is ancestors to Luthair Paendrag. Someone has started a rumor that a girl who looks like Tuon was extorting gold and jewelry from merchants. Anath is in seclution, Suroth is destraught. The Seeker knows a lot about Kared - he is 42, was born the property of Jalid Magonine in Ancarid. He distinguished himself at the Muyami Uprising and the Jianmin Incident. He served as bodyguard to the Empress until chosen to accompany Turak and the Hailene. He served as bodyguard to Tuo and kept a doll of hers named Emela for ten years until it was lost in a fire at Sohima. He has two living sons in the DG, his wife Kalia is dead. The Seeker tells him that on the same night as Tylin's death and Tuon's disappearance two damane disappeared as well as Tylin's pet, Thom and some soldiers. For some reason the Mor is super fixated on Thom. Lady Egeanin Tamarath took the damane. The Seeker suspects AS took Tuon and that Suroth is in with the AS. When Egeanin left the city gates she was heading north and Jehannah was mentioned at the palace stables. The Seeker thinks those are misdirects. The Seeker leaves and Karede calls Ajimbura and sends him with a message to Captain Musenge. They go to the Rahad and he rides up the Illian rode on his horse Aldazar. He meets Ajimbura who leads him to Captain Musenge and 100 DG and 20 Ogier Gardeners, the First Gardener is Hartha. 6 damane and sul'dam including Melitene, Tuon's personal der'sul'dam. One of the damane is Mylin. They set out to hunt down Tuon's kidnappers. </p>

    <h2>Ch 5, The Forging of a Hammer, Wolf</h2>
    <p><strong>Perrin.</strong> Alright, it's Perrin. We still haven't found Faile. Also, Selande brings news that Masema sent another rider back toward Amadicia, Masema has new supplies and followers gathered in Altara, and Masema has over 10,000 followers, and Masuri and Rovair have been meeting with Masema, also Annoura comes sometimes. Also, in the wolf dream, Perrin smells a scent worse than a Neverborn (Fade). He knows it means death, but he follows it anyway. Perrin also talks to the wolves and they don't answer him and they say "the Last Hunt is coming". Yep, that's all I caught. lol.</p>

    <h2>Ch 6, The Scent of a Dream, Wheel and Snake</h2>
    <p><strong>Perrin.</strong> Perrin smells the scent from his dream, it is DARKHOUNDS. Perrin remembers that Moiraine used balefire to stop the Darkhound in Illian. The trail circles the camp and headed south. Berelain brings Perrin a basket with breakfast and a note that Gendar and Santes stole from Masema's desk it says that the bearer is under the personal protection of HL Suroth Sabelle Meldarath of Asinbayar and Barsabba. Annoura advised destroying the note, Perrin keeps it. Perrin tells Berelain about Annoura and Masuri meeting Masema and Berelain says she'll look into it. Perrin shows everyone the Darkhound tracks. </p>

    <h2>Ch 7, Blacksmith's Puzzle, Ravens</h2>
    <p><strong>Perrin.</strong> Masuri inspects the DH tracks, and she is an EXPERT. She studied traces of seven different packs. Many believe there are few packs, seven, nine or thirteen. During the Trolloc Wars, Sorelana Alsahhan wrote that there were a hundred packs. Earlier, Ivonell Bharatiya wrote of 'numbers like unto the nightmares of mankind.' This is a new pack. It is huge, maybe fifty, instead of the normal ten or twelve. There is also a sense of urgency in the trace. WHOA! I bet there are probably the 100 packs and we'll see them at the Last Battle! Mark it.. ch 7 of COT > whatever chapter of whatever book is the last battle, we will count 100 packs of Darkhounds.</p>

    <p>Masema comes and tels them about a large town, So Harbor, that has large stores of food, Perrin thinks Masema is trying to delay freeing Faile. Arganda arrives with support bringing the numbers to Perrin's favor against Masema, and Masema and his men ride off. Arganda starts towards Perrin but changes direction when he sees two of the scouts returning from the east. </p>

    <h2>Ch 8, Whirlpools of Color, Aes Sedai</h2>
    <p><strong>Perrin.</strong> My first assumption was the colors had something to do with ta'veren. I still think that, but Perrin seemingly without thinking of Rand had an eruption of colors in his head and literally saw an image of Rand and Nynaeve facing each other. I WANT TO KNOW!</p>
    
    <p>So, Elyas and Elienda were the scouts. This crew Travels to the Shaido camp and there are 10,000 and 500 WOs who can channel. Also, Darkhounds are Shadowbrothers, the soul of a wolf corrupted by the Shadow. Perrin ends the discussion saying no ransom. He wants Elyas to show him the camp. Perrin recalls Nat Torfinn, a blind man who could work blacksmith's puzzles by touch, but Perrin must see a puzzle to work it. He sends Aram to bring Grady to the Traveling ground. Elyas smells the Darkhound trace. A Shadowbrother is the soul of a wolf corrupted by the Shadow. Darkhound and wolves will fight in the Last Battle. The Pattern is so complex it makes Sovarra lace look simple. Darkhound can eat the souls of wounded wolves turning them into more Darkhound. Perrin wonders if they can eat the soul of a Wolfbrother. Perrin paces with Stepper until Aram, Dannil and two dozen Two Rivers scouts arrive with Jur Grady. He is tired, but Fager Neald is just as tired and Grady is a bit stronger. He makes a gateway and Perrin rides through followed by Marline, Aram and the Two Rivers men, Gallenne and some Mayeners, Arganda and some Ghealdanin, and finally Annoura and Grady. The gateway is bigger than the first one Perrin remembers Grady making. Arganda fought in the Aiel War at Tar Valon.  Grady, Marline and Annoura are looking northwest and are badly shaken. Annoura wonders if the Forsaken have a sa'angreal or maybe even the Dark One is loose. She wants to go investigate, but Perrin tells them it is Rand's business. He orders Sulin to get him some prisoners. He will solve the puzzle, free Faile and destroy the Shaido. I literally don't know how this is going to end with the Shaido.</p>
    
    <h2>Ch 9, Traps, Falcon</h2>
    <p><strong>Faile.</strong> Rolan likes Faile, he's one of the Mera'din who joined Shaido. He saved Faile from another Shaido Nadric who went to do bad things to Faile. Also, Lacile and Arrela escaped three days ago, Bain and Chiad won't help them escape because Aiel, Morgase went to Therava's tent to steal the Oath Rod, Galina found Faile's knife and Sevanna is punishing Faile for that, Rolan shows up to warm Faile and massage her. 30 pages......</p>

    <h2>Ch 10, A Blazing Beacon, Aes Sedai</h2>
    <p><strong>Elayne.</strong> Oh whoa, this Aes Sedai logo is getting a lot of use this book - keep that in mind for the end of the book podcast! blah blah, Elayne is visiting minor Anodran Houses loyal to her. Elsie, a maid sees the ghost of Lady Nelein, Lord Aedmun's grandmother.. what is happening? Avi is there, she is a year older than Elayne so... 20? Elayne is weaing a Kandori necklace and ivory bracelet and the amber turtle brooch, and is suffering mood swings from her pregnancy! Elayne wishes Birg and Avi could remember what Min said about her baby. Rand had been south, but Traveled west. Avi has been doing the channeling lately because of Elayne's pregnancy, Elayne wonders about the effect of saidar on her unborn babies.. me too! What does that mean for the babe? And Aes Sedai don't really have children so.... hmmm. And then they feel the Power from Rand and Nynaeve. Avi has heard stories about the Choedan Kal. Elayne wants to go to help, Avi says no. Avi remembers her trip through Rhuidean (wow I haven't spelled that in a long time), and her future would be falling in love with Rand and she would have sister-wives, and that if they would go to Rand now something bad would happen. Elayne can feel Birg has a headache and a sour stomach.</p>
    
    <h2>Ch 11, Talk of Debts, Lion</h2>
    <p><strong>Elayne.</strong> Elayne takes Mellard to task! WOO! uh.. some more house things, Vandene has lost weight since Adeleas has died and she goes about her business followed by two novices, Kirstaian and Zarya. Elayne assures the other three that there is nothing they can do about the channeling. Merilille has worn the shawl over a hundred years and Careane over fifty, but they defer to Elayne because they are all only average strength. Careane dislikes Aviendha, considering her a wilder. Elayne is convinced that one of the three sisters is the murderer. Captain Doilin Mellar arrives. Sareitha approves of him but the other two dislike him. He led a sortie to rescue eighty of Lord Luan's men led by Jurad Accan when they were attacked by Lord Nasin's forces. Elayne chastises him for bringing Luan's armsmen into the city because he has not yet declared for her. She orders him to spend his time having those men watched. She then dismisses them all and goes to have a hot bath. She thinks that she always pays her debts and helps her friends pay theirs. I'm flying through this book, not out of enjoyment... lol. Hoping I'll be done soon lol. This is boring.</p> 
    
    <h2>Ch 12, A Bargain, Sea Folk</h2>
    <p><strong>Elayne.</strong> We've got another bargain on our hands! The SF have learned of Nesta's death and they are going to convene in Illian to determine who will be the new Mistress of the Ships. Elaynne also thinks about Galad and Gawyn. There is a commotion outside her rooms. Birgitte investigates while Aviendha fetches the amber turtle and the seated woman angreal. Three of the Sea Folk barge in past a furious Rasoria. They are Zaida and two Windfinders, Chanelle and Shielyn. They learned of the death of Nesta din Reas Two Moons. They plan to leave immediately for Illian to choose a new Mistress of the Ships. Elayne is dismayed as the Windfinders include most of the strongest channelers in the Royal Palace. This will seriously impede her ability to counter the siege with Traveling. Even worse, they want to take the three Aes Sedai with them as part of their bargain. Elayne counters that the bargain was with the Mistress of the Ships and that the Amyrlin would assign the teachers. Zaida comes back that Merilille personally agreed to teach, so they will keep her at least. Elayne gives in on that point. They set out on a new bargain. Elayne wants Zaida to leave the twenty-one Windfinders to weave gateways. In return, Elayne will cede them some land on the River Erinin River. Zaida refuses to negotiate on the two apprentices, Talaan and Metarra, and on the Windfinders to Wavemistresses. They finally agree on nine of the fourteen other Windfinders to be led by Chanelle. Elayne suspects that most of the Windfinders who are staying lost their ships in the battle at Ebou Dar.</p>
    
    <h2>Ch 13, High Seats, Lion</h2>
    <p><strong>Elayne.</strong> boring. Lord Perival of House Mantear, Lady Catalyn of House Haevin, Lord Branlet of House Gilyard and Lord Conail of House Northan are all children; only Conail is over sixteen. The sign of House Haevin is the Blue Bear. Catalyn's guardian was her uncle Lord Arendor. Branlet's guardian was Lady Mayv Gilyard, but she was killed. Perival's guardian is Lord Willin Mantear, but he is bedridden. Catalyn is also advised by her aunt Lady Evelle. The four of them pledge their Houses to support Elayne. Catalyn questions why Birgitte does not wear a sword. Elayne quotes Gareth Bryne saying that a general's army is his sword. They want to know if Reanne Corly is Aes Sedai, but Elayne dodges the question. They brought over three thousand armsmen with them. The only one who seems to have much sense is Perival. After some conversation, servants come to escort the four to their quarters. Dyelin is proud of what she accomplished in the past week. Lady Danine of House Candraed could not make up her mind, but the other four were successes. None wanted to see Arymilla on the throne. Dyelin is puzzled why Reanne Corly was so distracted. The high powered channeling has been going on for hours. Birgitte is disgusted. Conail offered to fight a duel with Arymilla's champion like Artur Hawkwing, though Hawkwing never did any such thing. Aviendha agrees that they are undependable children. Dyelin then says she became High Seat at fifteen when her father was killed. She successfully led her House against raiders from Altara and Murandy. Rasoria enters and announces that the First Maid and the First Clerk have come.</p>
    
    <h2>Ch 14, What Wise Ones Know, Flame of TV</h2>
    <p><strong>Elayne.</strong> Hey, not bad.. Avi being smart weaving an eavesdropping ward. Then Elayne and babes are all good! Rand and Nynaeve are done, so they can tell, Merilille left the palace three hours ago with a woman with tattooed hands. The SF are in a tizzy because one of their apprentices are missing. Guards are sent, and there will be inns checked... especially The Silver Swan. </p>
    
    <p>Reene Harfor reports first. Second Librarian Harnder is a spy. Every few days he visits an inn called The Hoop and Arrow. The innkeeper, Millis Fendry, keeps pigeons and every time Harnder visits, a pigeon flies north. Also, three sisters from The Silver Swan, all Brown Ajah, visited Millis Fendry yesterday. They have identified many spies in the Royal Palace, but this is the first Aes Sedai spy from an Ajah other than Red. Elaida would not have liked spies from other Ajahs. Now both the Reds and the Browns must know about the Kin. There are also spies for King Roedran of Murandy, Tairen High Lords, Cairhienin and some merchants. She has turned Jon Skellit, a spy for House Arawn into a mole. Elayne hopes he can learn in which of the four camps Arymilla, Elenia and Naean are staying.</p>
    
    <p>Halwin Norry reports next. There have been increasing cases of arson attempting to burn warehouses of food. Also, Houses Arawn, Marne and Sarand have taken out huge loans against their holdings, most likely to pay their own mercenaries and to try to bribe Elayne's mercenaries into turning sides.
    After Reene Harfor and Halwin Norry leave, Aviendha reports that someone tried to listen in. Birgitte reports that the Borderlanders are moving, but at their current pace it will take them a month to get to Caemlyn. She sent two of the Kin who can Travel, Sabeine Ocalin and Julanya Fote, to scout villages to the north. They believe the Borderlanders are camped for the winter. Elayne still hopes they will move south fast enough to force the Houses to unite with her. She knows that Bashere and Bael will keep their forces in check and the Lugard Road is far enough from the Black Tower so that the Asha'man will not become involved. The two Kin women also reported that Lord Luan, Lord Abelle and Lady Ellorien cannot be found. Lord Pelivar, Lady Arathelle and Lady Aemlyn left Murandy a few days ago and are moving back into Andor. Elayne says they must hope those six Houses do not reach Caemlyn before matters are settled. Otherwise, Dyelin must try to convince them to side with Elayne. The last time the Houses split three ways was five hundred years ago and it led to seven years of civil war.</p>
    
    <p>There is a knock on the door. Tzigan Sokorin announces Monaelle and Sumeko Karistovan. Monaelle stands high among the Wise Ones though she is weak in the One Power. Monaelle is Elayne's midwife and Sumeko came to study her techniques. Tzigan leaves with Dyelin and Birgitte. Monaelle chides Aviendha for missing so many lessons. She weaves Spirit, Fire and Earth in Caressing the Child, a weave unique to the Aiel that tells the health and condition of a pregnant woman and her baby. It is somewhat similar to weaves she learned from Sumeko and Nynaeve. She tells Elayne that there are two fetuses. Her worry about channeling is unfounded; it will not hurt the babies. Monaelle knows about the bond with Rand and that he is the real father, but none of the Kin know. Sumeko duplicates the weave. Aviendha begins, but stops when the powerful channeling to the west ends as suddenly as it began. They wonder if something wonderful or terrible happened. Elayne thinks it is wonderful, as Rand is still alive.</p>
    
    <p>Caseille knocks and enters with news. The Sea Folk are in an uproar because one of their apprentices, Talaan or Metarra, is missing. Also, Yurith Azeri reported that Merilille left the Royal Palace three hours ago accompanied by a woman with tattooed hands. Elayne orders Birgitte to sends guards to the gates. She then orders Sumeko to have Reanne send all of the Kin who cannot Travel to search the city, especially inns such as The Silver Swan. She hopes Rand did something wonderful, but right now she has to deal with Caemlyn.</p>
    
    <h2>Ch 15, Gathering Darkness, Dragon Fang</h2>
    <p><strong>Elenia Sarand.</strong> Drab and boring lol. Elenia is in a camp, accompanied by four men and her maid Janny. The sign of House Sarand is two Golden Boars. Houses Anshar, Baryn are there too. This winter siege was a dire mistake, she thinks. Elenia doesn't believe the rumors of the SF making holes in the air. She thinks Dyelin is the real power behind Elayne. There is another party approaching and the Triple Keys sigil of Howuse Arawn means the woman is Naean. Arymilla will not let Elenia near her husband Jarid, and forced Elenia, Jarid, and Naean to sign letters of support when she had them freed from their detention in Aringill. Arymilla is bad.  To keep them under control, she allows crazy Lord Nasin, High Seat of powerful House Caeren, to woo Elenia. She has a Taraboner named Jaq Lounalt  torment Naean. Naean is sure that Elenia has some plan to escape and begs her help. Elenia agrees on condition that Naean sign a letter forswearing Arymilla and pledging to support her. Naean reluctantly agrees. After Naean leaves, Elenia is elated. Naean's support will probably bring Karind and Lir. Ellorien will never support Trakand and she has feelers with Aemlyn, Arathelle, Abelle, Pelivar and Luan as well. Lord Nasin rides up with armsmen wearing the Sword and Star of Caeren, the most powerful of all the Andoran Houses. He tries to grope her until Janny gets between them. His wife, Miedelle Caeren, died thirty years ago. Arymilla rides up with armsmen wearing the Four Moons of House Marne. Naean is with her and so is Jaq Lounalt. She is also accompanied by Nasin's granddaughter and heir, Sylvase. hhhhgNasin thinks Arymilla is his daughter. Arymilla sends Nasin off with her maid Arlene. Arymilla invites Elenia, Naean and Sylvase to a repast prepared by Aedelle Baryn's cook. Arymilla tells them that Elenia and Naean will be sharing a bed that night. Elenia is stunned, wondering if this is a mindless gesture or if Arymilla somehow already found out about their earlier meeting. To clear her path to the throne, the only question is whether Arymilla or Nasin should die first.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Daved Hanlon.</strong> Daved kills someone, he doesn't know who sent them - Birgitte, and AS or Shiaine.. He goes to meet Shiaine. Hanlon is part of Falion's punishment. Falion tellshim about Marillin and Murellin.. great names. Falion goes to let Shiaine know that he arrived. He has visited a half dozen times. When she returns she describes the visitor, a slim Andoran with an air of authority. Two visitors yesterday wore the Golden Boars of Sarand and the Four Moons of Marne. Murellin is gross and awful to Falion, Falion asks Hanlon to give her something that she can give to Murellin to make him sleep. Shiaine murderd the visitor - and orders Hanlon to free some sul'dam, she also asks him if he would like to see Caemlyn looted and he replies yes. He asks to know more about the plan and Hanlon intends to kill Shiaine, Falion, and Marillin to leave no loose ends. </p>
    
    <h2>Ch 16, The Subject of Negotiations, Bull</h2>
    <p><strong>Egwene.</strong> I do declare, we are proabably going to get zero resolutions at the end of this book lol. This is a nothing book. AHHH. How much longer. Egwene and Gareth Bryne watch the White Tower from the riverbank to the west. The Alindrelle Erinin River and the Osendrelle Erinin River are each nearly a mile wide. Northharbor is blocked off with a huge iron chain to prevent attack. High Captain Jimar Chubain continues to bring in troops via river ship. She could sink the ships with the One Power, but that would be against the Three Oaths and Egwene insists on acting as though she has sworn on the Oath Rod. Bryne wants her to make gateways to bring his men into the city to fight, but she refuses. The White Tower must be preserved, not destroyed. She rides Daishar back to her waiting escort. They include Sheriam, Nisao and Sarin Hoigan, Morvrin and Jori, Myrelle and her three Warder, Anaiya and Setagana, Beonin and Tervail Dura. Carlinya has no Warder. They are now her official Council.
    While she was scouting the city Delana arrived. She continues to provoke the Hall calling for declarations that Elaida is Black Ajah. There are now 987 novices. Delana wants a private conversation. Delana asks if she intends to bond Bryne as her Warder. Egwene replies that she does not. She knows that she will bond Gawyn, but she does not know of he is still in Tar Valon or on his way to Caemlyn. Delana tells Egwene the Council gets their orders from their Ajah heads, not the Sitters, so their advice may be contrary to the Hall. Varilin, Takima, Magla, Faiselle and Saroiya have discussed negotiations with Elaida. All were Sitters before the break and are divided between Romanda and Lelaine.
    It is half a week since the eruption of the One Power. Yesterday Akarrin led a small party to investigate. It was difficult to convince anyone to go as they fear it was the work of the Forsaken.  Egwene discusses Delana's thoughts with her Council. Each is annoyed with the Sitter from her own Ajah, except for Beonin who agrees that they should at least try to negotiate. Delana is furious with her. Egwene says it is okay for her and the other five to try, but Elaida's exile is an absolute condition. Beonin nearly faints at the challenge. Egwene will do whatever it takes, even sacrificing herself, to keep the White Tower whole. She has a plan if she can find a way to make it succeed.</p>
    
    <h2>Ch 17, Secrets, Ravens</h2>
    <p><strong>Egwene.</strong> Okay, this was good! So we've got the ability to create cuendillar again! That is awesome! I agree it is important to negotiate with Elaida btw.. smart. No need for people to die just to die. Also food keeps rotting DESPITE weaves of Keeping?? Gotta be darkfriends.... They have been there nearly two weeks. Most of Gareth Bryne's troops occupy the bridge towns on both sides of the river. At the camp, Anaiya, Beonin, Carlinya, Morvrin, Myrelle and Nisao go back to their Ajah heads. They will not tell Egwene who the heads of their Ajahs are. Sheriam and Arinvar go to her tent. Egwene rides Daishar around the camp on a casual inspection. Much of their food is rotting despite weaves of Keeping.There are twenty-one Accepted in the camp. She sees two Browns, Phaedrine and Shemari, arrive from one of the Traveling Grounds and wonders where they have been.
    Egwene goes to another tent. Leane exits. A novice, Letice Murow, comes by and Leane has her hold Daishar. The tent is where they test for ability to make cuendillar. Tiana and Sharina Melloy supervise even though Sharina is only a novice. Kairen and Ashmanaille work at one table watched by Janya Frende and Salita Toranes. Salita is a Sitter despite being Aes Sedai only thirty-five years. Janya, Lelaine and Lyrelle were the only pre-schism Sitters to stand at the War Vote. They weave Earth, Fire and Air around iron cups trying to convert them. Strength in Earth is the key; only nine other sisters, two Accepted and two dozen novices can make the weave at all. Only three sisters besides Elayne can make ter'angreal. The valuable items will be sold to raise money. Egwene figured out the cuendillar weave from faint hints by Moghedien. Sharina dismisses two of the novices, Bodewhin and Nicola, to their classes with Adine. Areina leaves with Nicola. Sharina then leaves to help with the cooking. Tiana has worn the shawl over thirty years. Kairen spends a lot of time with Lelaine. Althyn Conly and Bodewhin Cauthon tried to change two iron cups to cuendillar at the same time. They got one solid lump. Egwene is the best at making cuendillar, then Leane, then Kairen, then Bodewhin. She has them honing their skill as it is part of her secret plan to take Tar Valon. Leane is barely fast enough, but Kairen is still too slow. She thinks Beonin's negotiations may buy her a little more time. The plan must be kept secret until it is time to reveal it to the world.</p>
    
    <h2>Ch 18, A Chat with Siuan, Forsnaken</h2>
    <p><strong>Egwene.</strong> A lot to do with what the e-a-e have heard.. lets' go! Halima is angry at Egwene and Eg's headache stars... hmm - it's Halima using saidin, but I don't know how lol. Hey I don't suspect Cadsuane as a Darkfriend... do you?? And a Hall meeting has been called. 
    Egwene tells Siuan about the Sitters' interest in negotiations with Elaida. Siuan is angry, but she notes that six Sitters from five Ajahs left the tower "and here we have one from each of those five." Siuan scouted the White Tower in Tel'aran'rhiod last night and partially saw a list of Sitters including the replacements for some of those who left. They include Andaya Forae - Gray, Rina Hafden - Green, Juilaine Madome - Brown. They have all worn the shawl seventy years or less. Siuan says this makes "maybe twelve, but eleven for sure between us and the Tower." There are also Ferane Neheran - White and Suana Dragand - Yellow. Both were Sitters at an earlier time. Egwene orders Siuan to find out what she can about the puzzle. They go over eyes-and-ears reports that other Ajahs are willing to pass on. They also have Leane's report from her eyes-and-ears in Tar Valon itself. The city is becoming dirty and dangerous as patrols only pay attention to the harbors. There is little news from lands controlled by the Seanchan. People seem to be accepting them as the new rulers. There are confusing rumors about King Alsalam and Rodel Ituralde in Arad Doman. The Green Ajah is particularly concerned about the Borderlanders near New Braem. Siuan's agent in New Braem reported that they have Aes Sedai with them. Egwene hopes she can introduce her plan for the Kin before the Hall finds out about the bargain with the Sea Folk. The Hall thinks that Vandene and Merilille have Elayne under control. Egwene plans for the Kin to be directly associated with the White Tower. Aes Sedai can forswear the Oath Rod and retire into the Kin. She thinks they will agree when they learn that the Oath Rod cuts their life span in half. Reanne Corly can prove when she was in the White Tower and so can others. There are reports of large numbers of wilders among the Sea Folk in Illian and Tear. Lord Gregorin in Illian is threatened by the Seanchan and High Lord Darlin Sisnera is besieged by nobles who want Rand out of Tear. Merana Ambrey was spotted at the Stone of Tear negotiating with Tedosian and Estanda. Egwene worries that that is proof that Aes Sedai now work for Rand and she fears there may be Compulsion involved. She knows the weave for Compulsion from Moghedien. Siuan's agents are keeping close tabs on Cadsuane in Cairhien. Siuan suspects she is a Darkfriend. Anaiya enters with word that Akarrin and the others have returned. Moria has called the Hall to meet. Morvrin and Myrelle enter saying that Escaralde and Malind have also called for a meeting. </p>
    
    <h2>Ch 19, Surprises, Flame</h2>
    <p><strong>Egwene.</strong> Oh man, this is AWESOME! Hall meeting comes to a conclusion... THE HALL WILL ALIGN WITH THE BLACK TOWER AND SEND AN... EMBASSY! I'm pumped. Akarrin and Nisain go to Shadar Logoth where the Power was used and determine A LOT OF SAIDIN AND SAIDAR was used, more saidin than saidar and everyone is scared that the Forsaken have a huge weapon against us now, so that's where the alignment with the BT started from. NICE!</p>

    <p>Romanda starts the meeting. She was a Sitter for almost eighty years. Faiselle, Lyrelle and Samalin arrive. The meeting starts as Janya arrives. Lelaine wants to talk about the move to negotiate with Elaida, but Moria calls for the report from Akarrin first. Delana finally arrives out of breath. Aledrin, the second youngest Sitter, calls the investigators to question. Akarrin reports the hole they found where Shadar Logoth used to be and that it was an alien weave. They were chosen because of expertise in reading residues. Nisain is the best. She reports that there was far more saidin than saidar. They have no defense against such an attack. Clearly planned in advance, Moria, Escaralde and Malind propose strengthening circles with men from the Black Tower. Sheriam shrieks. Faiselle, Varilin, Saroiya, Takima and Magla react violently. Egwene shuts down the near hysteria and calls for discussion and a vote. Moria points out that the Black Tower is the only way they can possibly counter whatever happened at Shadar Logoth. Also, cooperation will give them some slight control over the dangerously unstable Asha'man. Sheriam sobs uncontrolledand Delana looks green. Magla, Faiselle, Varilin, Saroiya and Takima speak against the proposal. Egwene calls for the vote. Janya stands first joining Moria, Escaralde and Malind. Samalin follows, then Salita, Berana, Aledrin and Kwamesa. After a time, Romanda stands. Lelaine stands followed by Lyrelle. Delana stays seated with the five who spoke against the proposal, but twelve carries the lesser consensus. Egwene has to remind Sheriam of her next duty, asking for the greater consensus. Delana stands but the other five refuse. They begin planning for an embassy to the Black Tower. </p>
