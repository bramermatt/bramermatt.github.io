    <summary>Notes as I Read</summary>
    <h2>Header</h2>
    <p>"And it shall come to pass, in the days when the Dark Hunt rides, when the right hand falters and the left hand strays, that mankind shall come to the Crossroads of Twilight and all that is, all that was, and all that will be shall balance on the point of a sword, while the winds of the Shadow grow. —from The Prophecies of the Dragon translation believed done by Jain Charin, known as Jain Farstrider, shortly before his disappearance"</p>

    <h2>Prologue, Glimmers of the Pattern, Wheel and Snake</h2>
    <p><strong>Rodel Ituralde.</strong> Rodel is the Wolf, not Perrin, but is known as the Wolf. He is in Arad Doman riding Dart, with twenty armsmen. He has an officer named Jaalam Nishur with them. Rodel has been working to save Arad Doman from being overrun by Dragonsworn. Many nobles formerly loyal to the King have now switched sides, since King Alsalam went into hiding after his orders seemed intent on causing chaos.... DAMANDRED IS KING ALSALAM?!!? The orders move his army around searching for a Dragonsworn army that is never found. Other orders to nobles Machir, Teacal, and Rahman have led to battles with his own men. Ituralde has Solanje, Maseen, Lake Somal, and Kandelmar. The Lords of Katar do not sell to Dragonsworn anymore, a Gray Man killed Lady Tuva trying to stop his last orders. No one is sure of Alsalam's location, but he is not in Bandar Eban. Donjel, a scout, rides up and says the meeting Ituralde arrounged at the Lady Osana's hunting lodge with leaders of the Dragonsworn is ready. However, Osana vanished some time ago, was that Graendal? WHOA, MAYBE! Donjel takes a letter from Ituralde to give to his wife Tamsin Ituralde in case he doesn't make it to Coron Ford. Ituralde and his men meet with Lord Shimron, Domani Lords Rajabi, Wakeda, and Ankaer. There is also a Tarabon in a seperate group. Ituralde announces the SC have moved into the ALmoth Plain and he means to stop them! Alsalam's latest orders are to attack the SC. Ituralde offers a truce to help defend Arad Doman, he will send the Tarabon back home to retake their homeland and he will accompany him. He has a secret plan.. uh oh. </p>

    <p><strong>Eamon Valda.</strong> Lord-Captain Commander Eamon Valda is in the Whitecloak camp in the northern Amadicia, there are 9,000 Whitecloaks. It's been a month since the SC took Amador. King Ailron was killed in the battle with the SC at Jeramel. There is a terrible odor, but it disappears quickly.. hmm. He meets with Asunama to talk him into meeting the rest of the Council - the surviving ten Lord Captains. There are rumors of an Andoran army in Murandy. Valda is furious that Morgase escaped or was killed and now Galad is no longer useful. Asunawa wants to go after the AS in Murandy, but he finally agrees to meet with the Council - they will ride tonight! </p>

    <p><strong>Gabrelle.</strong> Gabrelle (one of Logain's bonded Reds), with Toveine, and Logain are riding in the woods near the BT. Two weeks have gone by since they were captured. Desandre and Lemai ordered all the sisters to be coridal with their captors in hopes of getting on their good side. Gabrelle sees a strange bird.. hmm. The bonding feeling is new to Gabrelle, she is Red and never had a Warder. There is increasing tension between Logain and Taim's factions. Atal Mishraile rides up bringing a message that the M'Hael has granted Logain's request to go recruiting. Logain announces that he must return to make preparations, TOv and Gab are determined to go with him. - - Ahhhh, I so want to see a man who can channel feel the clean source.. CAN'T WAIT!</p>

    <p><strong>Yukiri.</strong> Aes Sedai Black Ajah plots.. we must sus out the BA! Yukiri and Midanai (grays) walk in the WT. There are only about 200 sisters in the WT. Meidani's Warder is Leonin. Meidani is one of the rebl moles. Saerin and Pevara decided to keep them scret until their usefulness runs out. There is still no news of Coiren and the embassy to Rand. Yukiri fears for her life. She is now sure Tamra Ospenya (Amyrlin) didn't die naturally. They run into three Browns, Marris Thornhill, Doraise Mesianos and Elin Warrel. Elaida seems fiercer than ever since her private penance with Silviana. They pass a pair of Yellow sisters, Pritalle Nerbaijan with her Warder and Atuan Larisett. She is Black Ajah. Talene exposed the other two of her circle, Galina Casban and Temaile Kinderode, and her outside contact Atuan. Yukiri hopes Atuan will lead them to the other two of her circle. Three sisters were murdered at the time Temaile disappeared and others disappeared with her. The two Yellow rebel moles, Celestin and Annharid, are trying to learn about Atuan's friends. Alviarin left yesterday or the day before. Yukiri orders Meidani to take this opportunity to renew her novice friendship with Elaida. Siuan was Elaida's protégée when they were novice and Accepted. They pass a tapestry depicting the humbling of Queen Rhiannon. Seaine shows up with Bernaile Gelbarn. It has been almost two months since Elaida came to Seaine, nearly two weeks since Yukiri found Seaine and Pevara. They discuss the mystery of the heads of the Ajahs secretly meeting. After the rebels left, the Ajah heads apparently handpicked the new Sitters. Serancha[10] personally chose Andaya for the Gray. Juilaine was chosen for the Brown Ajah. Suana was chosen for the Yellow Ajah. Ferane left the White Sitters less than ten years ago, but was re-selected. Adelorna handpicked Rina for the Green. Talene told them Adelorna was head of the Green Ajah. There are two new Browns, Shevan being the other. The Brown was the only Ajah to have two Sitters join the rebels.</p>

    <p><strong>Gawyn.</strong> Hey Gawyn! Gawyn is in Dorlan east of TV. An army appeared out of nowhere and now surrounds TV (EGWENE AND CREW). Rajar says an AS has arrived from the WT. Gawyn, Rojar, Tomil are at the Mayor's house. Garon Burlow is the Mayor. Katerine and Tarna are there and have taken over the house. Tarna arrived the day the army appeared, Tarna also displaced Lusonia COle from her room and took command of the eleven other sisters from Covarla Baldene. She is trying to get to TV. Katerine arrived yesterday, and took command from Tarna. Narenwin arrives with orders for Gawyn from the Amyrlin (he doesn't know which Amyrlin). Narenwin was sent to take charge, she escaped TV on a fishing boat. Katerine and Tarna are trying to get to TV and they will leave in the monring to go to TV.</p>
