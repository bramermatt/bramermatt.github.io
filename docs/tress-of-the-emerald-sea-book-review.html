    <summary>Notes as Read</summary>
<p><em>Part 1</em></p>
<h2>Ch 1: The Girl</h2>
<p><strong>Tress.</strong> We meet Glorf, sorry Tress. She lives on an island, Diggen's Point. There are dangerous spores that fall from the Verdant Lunagree. Tress likes the island and is happy. </p> 

<h2>Ch 2: The Groundskeeper</h2>
<p><strong>Tress.</strong> Ah, now this.. this feels Cosmere to me. Charlie, secretly the Duke's son, talking to Tress about the cup, and it's an Iriali cup! From the Stormlight Archive. Oh I'm so happy.</p>
  
<h2>Ch 3: The Duke</h2>
<p><strong>Tress.</strong> Oh this is wonderful. Well not for Tress, but this is wonderful. This story is being setup so nicely. Charlie rests her hand on Tress's hand, Tress fumbles her words and they smile. He smile tells her that he loves her. He didn't actually say it. Then, the Duke arrives. Tress leaves, and the next morning hears the news that the Duke and his son are leaving the island that very day. 
</p>
 
<h2>Ch 4: The Son</h2>
<p><strong>Tress.</strong> HOID! Charlie finds her and speaks to her, and Tress says she wishes he didn't have to go marry someone else. Charlie promises her that he won't marry any of the princesses, that he'll be so boring that none of them can stand him. He promises to send her a cup at every stop, after he gets the resident princess to reject him. In the following months, Tress receives several cups and letters from Charlie, describing how he offended or grossed out various marriage candidates. But eventually, the cups stop coming. A year after Charlie's departure, word arrives at Diggen's Point that the duke is returning with his wife, heir, and daughter-in-law. </p>
 
<h2>Ch 5: The Bride</h2>
<p><strong>Tress.</strong> Holy crap! Okay, LET'S GO TRESS! So this Sorceress in the Midnight Sea? Have we heard that before? The duke comes back and announces his new heir, Dirk his nephew. Charlie "died". Actually, Charlie tried hard to put off all the princesses, but the duke figured out what he was doing and sent him to the Midnight Sea, where he was captured by the Sorceress. Tress learns from the duke's steward, Brunswick, that they'd received a ransom letter from the Sorceress, which the duke declared to be a trick. After two months of lethargically going about her daily tasks, Tress decides to go out and save Charlie on her own.</p>
