<p>What an enjoyable read, a true classic fantasy story. A true adventure story, and an amazing tale that changed the world.</p>

<p>My one criticism would have to be the ending. It seemed a bit rushed, after so much time to be so quick, it seemed disconnected almost.</p>

<p>The singing and the ending were what brought this to a 4/5 for me. The singing took me out of the story, I didn’t want to read that as I was reading this story. I’d rather read the story!</p>
