    <p>I'm really happy to be back reading the Wheel of Time. Make sure to check out my <a href="../../html/reviews/franchise/wheel-of-time-in-review.html">Wheel of Time in Review</a>!</p>

    <div class="two-thirds-img-columns">
        <div>
            <p>I am currently reading, as of April 8, 2023, and I'm no where near being done - so this is going to be a review in progress! And below, I'm going to have notes as I read, by chapter. More than likely spoilers, so I'm going to keep those hidden by the box below. When I've finished my read, the Notes box will be moved below the spoiler box, probably past the score!</p>

    <!-- <h2>Review Score</h2>
    <p>I'm trying a new way of reviewing, by implementing a new way to review - using a format taken from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@2ToRamble" target="_blank">2toRamble</a>! <em>And that’s the system! Rate those 5 categories out of 10, average your score, and that’s your /10 Rambler Rating! You can rate each category to the nearest hundredth, tenth, whole number, or whatever you please.</em></p>
        
    <p>This comes out to a total score of 5! An incredible book!</p> -->

        <h2>Prologue - The First Sparks Fall</h2>
        <p>Back into the Wheel of Time... HERE WE GO! This Prologue was huge! Elaida as Amarylin.. this is incredible to see - I'm terrified to see what happens with Elaida. I'm really interested in these paintings that Elaida has on the wall. I'm also interested in learning about all the Blues not being there anymore. Is it true that really ALL THE BLUE AJAH are gone?</p>

        <p>Padan Fain MADE IT TO THE WHITE TOWER?! That was fast. Two months.. interesting.</p>

        <p>RHAVIN, Lanfear, Sammael, and Grandael.. THIS WAS AMAZING! I'm so excited to learn more about the Chosen and so much about their plans. This is facinating, really. I'm really glad to see the getting the information we've gotten so far of the Chosen. SO GOOD.</p>


        <h2>Fanning the Sparks</h2>
        <p>MIN - Oh this was nice! I'm really glad to be back with Min, Siuan, and Leane. THIS IS SO GOOD. I'm happy to see Logain helping the girls (I don't even know what to call them right now..). This is good.</p>

        <p>GARETH BRYNE - I like this. I really like Gareth Bryne.</p>

        <p>ALTEIMA - OH MY MY MY! Gaebril / Rhavin... whoa - it is crazy to see Compulsion happening on the other end. Wow. Scary.</p>

        <p>MORGASE - And Morgase misses Bryne.. aw.</p>

        <h2>Ch 2 - Rhuidean</h2>
        <p>HOLY SMOKES. Everything is so good here. So deep. There is so much good stuff here. So much of the Aiel - so much of Rhuidean. SO MUCH GOOD STUFF. Beautiful writing by Jordan, beautiful worldbuilding by Jordan... so so good. I can't believe we are learning so much so early - that's just my thoughts even though I'm in book five.. it's just so good. I'm so happy.</p>

        <p>Now, about this talk of LTT's Hundred Companions.. I want a full page of names of these companions in one really long sentence - I'm sure RJ could do that! I don't know I just really like the idea of having these named characters for this story of LTT and his Hundred Companions.</p>

        <p>Now, I love the descriptions of sadin and saidar.. beautiful. Also, it is very fascinating that Rand can feel when Moraine and/or Egwene are embracing saidar but he doesn't know who. I wonder if that ability will ever be found.</p>

        <p>Also also, LTT in Rand's head... AWESOME. So much in just the second chapter of this book.. gets me hyped up for the rest of the book!</p>


        <h2>Ch 3 - Pale Shadows</h2>
        <p>I love this chapter. I'm so happy.</p>

        <p>RAND - YES YES YES. Rand + ASMO. YES YES YES.</p>

        <p>I love the way Rand and Asmodean communicate. I am happy that Rand is getting so powerful - this is good!</p>

        <p>MAT - oh Mat, you're awesome. This is so much fun. I'm really happy to be reading these Mat perspectives.... SO GOOD! Mat is awesome. I love this Melindhra as well wink - that was awesome. And I really appreciate Mat trying to get Rand's attention.</p>

        <p>Also, next chapter.. we are still with Rand... YES!</p>

        <h2>Ch 4 - Twilight</h2>
        <p>So good.. Rand is jealous hmm. This is really interesting about Isandre and Rand having to hide that she and Kadere are Darkfriends.</p>

        <h2>CH 5 - Among the Wise Ones</h2>
        <p>I love this. I really haven't been too blown away by Egwene chapters. I just am so excited to read Rand and Mat chapters. But this was a good one. I feel like I really like where Egwene is at in her power, character arc, and everything about her. I hope she goes far in the series - I'm sure she might. But I'm really interested in TAR.</p>

        <p>What the heck is the bleakness?! ... I typed this and then listened to podcast ep 504 on this chapter. I think I understand it now.</p>

        <p>I'm still confused on the Aiel customs, of course. So, Melaine isn't married? but Dorindha is married to Bael? And she wants to marry them?</p>

        <p>And Isendre... what is going on here?! Also, Lanfear / Keille.. is she just gone?</p>

        <h2>Ch 6 - Gateways</h2>
        <p>Well this was awesome. Rand and the Darkhounds.. Mat with Melindhra, what is with this foxhead medallion - does that have something to do with... OH! Mat asked to not have anything to do to deal with Aes Sedai. So with the foxhead medallion - is that where Moiraines Healing was focused on?? HMM I HAVE NO IDEA! Reading on!</p>

        <p>Okay I need to compose my thoughts here. Good GRIEF. I am sitting in my work break room trying to keep myself from jumping up and down. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE. WOW WOW WOW.</p>

        <h2>Predictions as of Chapter 6</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Rand will absolutely be able to raise the dead (I have no idea how yet)</li>

        <li>Rand is literally insanely powerful.. that’s the prediction lol</li>
    </ul>
        <p>These books are going to be so jam packed with world building and magic - I can’t even imagine what the later books are going to be like. This is so good.</p>

        <p>Let me talk about Balefire.. WHAT?! IT REMOVES THINGS FROM THE PATTERN.. also thank you Brett for your help on the podcast (wow!). I am really interested in how this Balefire works....</p>

        <h2>Ch 7 - A Departure</h2>
        <p>Hey, whoever said someone clomping around on a horse describing people and their thoughts weren't fun.. have not read this chapter! WHOA. This was great! I really liked this chapter and I'm sure there is an incredible amount of detail that I missed about all the things that Egwene said - but I'm excited to hear how the Ogier are going to rebuild Rhuidean.. that's awesome! I love this Mat / Melindhra duo.. cute lol. And Rand's "until I return.. think of me.." water out of everywhere in Rhuidean.. so cool.</p>

        <p>Now Moiraine.. hmm, she's great. I love seeing her perspectives. Also, is she great?! I'm worried about her. I feel like she is going to die out of nowhere and no one is going to be able to stop it. I'm worried because she is so one-track mind.. and that's the Dragon Reborn fulfilling prophesies, but it just scares me. I don't want her to die. I appreciate her giving Rand her Oath to help her, and I appreciate the openness of all of that, but we'll see. hmm.</p>

        <p>Love this book so far.</p>

        <h2>Ch 8 - Over the Border</h2>
        <p>OOOOOO a Nynaeve perspective.. happy Matt!</p>

        <p>Oh boy, oh boy. This just makes me happy. I'm really glad to have gotten this insight into Nynaeve, Elayne, Thom, and Juilin. I do love their group and how they interact. Let me tell you, all these people *trying* to go to Tar Valon... that is going to be **bad**. I am so scared for all these people on their way.</p>

        <p>Also, Whitecloaks = scary! Dumb, but SCARY! Almost.. like Storm troopers? Is that something Brett has said before, still scary.</p>

        <p>I do love this book so far.</p>

        <h2>Ch 9 - A Signal</h2>
        <p>I mean come on girls… good grief. Why would you drink tea from someone you don’t know who also ISNT DRINKING THE TEA THEMSELVES!</p>

        <p>Also prediction: Nynaeve will overcome this being angry to channel (and I think Mogi helped her inadvertently realize what the issue was - that Nynaeve is scared.. right?) but she will overcome it! That’s my hope!</p>

        <h2>Ch 10 - Figs and Mice</h2>
        <p>I tell you what, I can't even begin to think about where all these pigeons are going. Of course, one is going to Tar Valon, but I have no idea where the other two exact copies are going.</p>

        <p>I am also very happy we get Nynaeve saying "thank you" to Thom and Juilin.. also IS NYNAEVE GOING TO BE A YELLOW AJAH?! WOW! I am interested in Elayne with Black Hair.. I can imagine there is going to be some changes in her life when she comes back into contact with people who know her with her reddish hair. Interesting!</p>

        <p>Loving this so far.</p>

        
        <h2>Ch 11 - The Nine Horse Hitch</h2>
        <p>Back with Siuan, Leane, Min, and Logain! Okay - I'm liking what I'm seeing here. I love being in Siuan's perspective. Siuan is awesome. I'm really enjoying these eyes-and-ears.. we're getting a lot out of this from these recent chapters, but I'm interested in more! Min is great too. I just feel worried about what is going to happen next for this crew. I'm worried that something is going to be bad and I'm just worried. Here we go!</p>
        
       
        <h2>Ch 12 - An Old Pipe</h2>
        <p>I mean is there anyone not to like in these books really? I feel for Bryne. I feel for him in his current predicament and for all he’s had to go through and for all that he is going to try to do. I like him a lot! I’m continuing my worry for Siuan, Min, Leane, and Logain. What is going to happen?!</p>
        
        <h2>Ch 13 - A Small Room in Sienda</h2>
        <p>Okay, first off.. where is Perrin, Faile, Gaul, Bain, Chiad, Loial - where are they all?! We haven't heard anything from them the entire book! Okay, let's talk about this chapter... Okay so we're about to get some TAR.. SWEET! And My guess is possibly that this group and Siuan's group will be close to each other?? I think - if the map looks right.. idk. Otherwise, I'm enjoying this!</p>
        
        <h2>Ch 14 - Meetings</h2>
        <p>Oh Nynaeve.. Okay let's get into it! Wow. I love this chapter. We get Birgitte in TAR and more info about Forsaken + Heroes in TAR and that Gaidal Cain has been born again.. wow. Great stuff! Learning about Mogi's name in the Old Tongue gets me excited to learn what Lanfear means haha! OH THE PRESCRIPTS! WHO HAS IMPLIMENTED THOSE. HOW DO THEY WORK?! Okay, Egwene and Melaine with Nynaeve. Hmm. Nynaeve is about to burst! And as this chapter ends... good grief Nynaeve - she is going to get herself in big trouble.</p>
        
        <h2>Ch 15 - What Can Be Learned in Dreams</h2>
        <p>I am glad Egwene and Nynaeve finally know that Elaida is Amyrlin! Man I felt like a friend in an awkward conversation with two lifelong friends with the conversation between Egwene and Nynaeve. I mean it was difficult to read since I felt for Nynaeve but Egwene was GOING OFF on Nynaeve. I also hope to see the Blues that are left. I can't believe that they're all dead. I just hope they're safe. Now reading Egwene’s perspective! I LOVE WHEN EGWENE TALKS ABOUT HER DREAMS! YES! Okay, Rand sitting down in a chat - not his chair a woman's chair... OH WOW. THE AMYRLIN'S SEAT?! Is Rand going to sit in the Amyrlin's seat?? That's gotta be the seat.. right? Perrin and Faile - with the Manetheran Banner and the Wolf's head banner.. nice. And the Tinker (ARAM), why does Egwene feel a chill of doom when he gets close to Perrin?? OH NO! Mat with his dice and wound.. hmm. Thom reaching in a fire to bring out the blue stone that is apparenlty on Moraine's forhead... WHAT?!?!?! Are Thom and Moiraine connected in some way or will be connected in some way?? Lastly a storm with lightning bolts.. spooky. Oh this book is so enjoyable. In my lifetime, I've ridden a horse twice. And it was so incredible. This book is reinvigorating that love - oh wow I can just remember how it felt hopping up into the stirrups and galloping along. AHHHH SOO GOOD!</p>
        
        <p>Okay... Egwene feeling close to choosing her Ajah! What in the world would she choose? I mean, I feel after this conversation she's looking very Blue to me. But really, I don't think I know of every Ajah in depth. Nynaeve, I feel, is looking for Yellow (healing). And Elayne has thought about Green (battle!), but I don't know if she will actually choose that. A lot is still up in the air!</p>
        
        <p>LOVE THIS BOOK!</p>
        
        <h2>Ch 16 - An Unexpected Offer</h2>
        <p>AHHHHHH!!! If you can't tell I'm screaming. Whoa, this is crazy and exciting and I'm so down for it. We are getting more of this menagerie... I can't wait! Am I to understand that Thom and Juilin will go with them? Okay, Galad. Wow. He is SCARY! At least what he can do is scary. And he says that Siuan has been stilled and executed! Nynaeve and Elayne are shaken... Thankfully we know that's not true. Now let's talk Thom and Elayne...... I imagine a kiss is necessary but nothing more will come of it - that's my prediction. Thom will be the one to call it off. That's what I think. Oh this is so good.</p>
        
        <h2>Ch 17 - Heading West</h2>
        <p>THE CIRCUS! Or the menagerie.. lol I’m excited. I love Valan Luca, I’m interested to see what his character does when paired with Nynaeve, Elayne, Thom, and Juilin - he seems quite the showman and I’m excited. Oh oh the SEANCHAN! Yup that’s going to get wild I think. very interesting how subservient she’s acting… interesting. Holy smokes.. ALUDRA! The Illuminator Mat and Thom met! Onto a LIANDRIN perspective, WHAT?!</p>
        
        <h2>Ch 18 - A Hound for Darkness</h2>
        <p>Okay I was excited about a Loandrin perspective, and then Moghedien shows up?! Wow! A good and SCARY chapter. Wow. This is going to be good. I mean bad. I mean good. Oh this is going to be awesome! I’m very worried about Nynaeve and Elayne now - this is going to be bad for them and I don’t want that. Wow, Moghedien is scary.</p>

        <h2>Ch 19 - Memories</h2>
        <p>Okay, I did not expect a chapter with Morgase as the POV and Fain as the second POV to be my favorite chapter of this book so far but GOOD GRIEF. I also don't think that's true, but this chapter is up there with the earlier Rhuidean chapters... well really, this WHOLE BOOK IS AMAZING! Okay let's get into this... Wow, I was really feeling horrible for Morgase here - she's Compelled by Gaebril / Rhavin but not all the time and that's torture. Oh I felt so bad for her here. And then we get Tallanvor.. love him - he's such a good guy. Loves his Queen Morgase! WOO! And we get Lini! That's awesome. Love this. I love it all. And I'm really glad we get to see them all leave safely. I was really worried. So much awesome happened in Morgase's POV it almost couldn't have been topped.. and then we get a FAIN POV.. YES!</p>
        
        <p>Okay Fain.. Padan Fain, Mordeith, Master Fain.... WHOA. I mean talk about a plot bombshell here - Shayol Ghul and his experience with Shayol Ghul.. GOOD GRIEF. And Fain gets the dagger back and he kills Verine (accepted) and then Alviarin is Black Ajah (i'm too hyped up on this chapter to remember, but I think we definitely knew that already). But this talk of Thakan'dar... SO SO GOOD. SO SO GOOD. Also, Fain nicked himself, I don't guess that will be much an issue for him.. right?</p>
        
        <h2>Ch 20 - Jangai Pass</h2>
        <p>Shoot. This is good. I’m loving this Rand. He Who Comes With the Dawn and The Dragon Reborn looks good on Rand lol. He has such power and it’s just so cool. RJ is such a beautiful writer. I’m impressed! And now, this is getting rowdy. Couladin is crazy and I have literally no idea what to expect from him. What on earth is he going to do to Rand and these Aiel?! Also, Mat is so good. So so good. And wait wait! Is this the first we’ve gotten full written description of Laman’s Sin?? Whoa!</p>
        
        <h2>Ch 21 - The Gift of a Blade</h2>
        <p>Good golly Aviendha! LAMAN'S SWORD?! Wow, that's awesome! I expect Rand to keep this sword for a long time, possible put it up on a wall behind a desk as he commands an Army or something like that... that'd be cool. Or he could use it? Or does he need to use it anymore, since he can channel? It seems like a remarkable sword. Okay, I am glad Rand is able to set a ward across the whole camp against Shadowspawn, that's awesome. Will Mat take up his Spear for Melindhra.. hmm. Maybe!</p>
        
        <h2>Ch 22 - Birdcalls at Night</h2>
        <p>I tell you what, this book is ramping up to something big! Woo! Oh wow, this is really awesome. Not just for Mat getting a little frisky with Melindhra, but everything. This is such a cool book, a cool series, and incredible characters. Wow. This is awesome. Do we really think Asmo cares that Rand is saying things that LTT is / did say? How do I even communicate this.. Rand has LTT in his head, because Rand is the Dragon Reborn, the Dragon being LTT. The Heroes of the Horn called him LTT because that’s what they see - Rand’s soul / LTT’s soul. So this is LTT being part of Rand in the things he is saying and thinking. That’s my prediction, although, I think it’s pretty clear right??</p>
        
        <h2>Ch 23 - "The Fifth, I Give You"</h2>
        <p>I love Rand in charge. Wow, this is so great to see! From what we saw in TEOTW to now.. this is great! Although, I fear there is going to be some bad things coming Rand and the Aiel's way - Couladin and such. But I'm just worried about Aviendha (she is getting pushed around and I don't like it!). Also, I feel we are gearing up for something HUGE!</p>
        
        <h2>Ch 24 - A Message Sent</h2>
        <p>Yeesh. This is good. I forgot that Egwene doesn't know about the Heroes of the Horn being in TAR. Interetsing. Should I care about this fight with Nynaeve and Chavana (or those people in the Menagerie?)
        I'm not sure if I've said this before but this Mat + Daughter of the Nine Moons is CERTAINLY A SEANCHAN. WHOA. That's crazy, right? I imagine the Seanchan will eventually become less and less of a threat.</p>
        
        <h2>Ch 25 - Dreams of Galad</h2>
        <p>WHAT DID I JUST READ... WHOA! I appreciate that we got the Mogi perspective to tell us what the heck was happening with Egwene's dreams here. I was confused so I was happy to see that Mogi can literally weave the Power around you and make you have dreams that Mogi wants you to have.... THE IMPLICATIONS?! Mogi said that Birgitte was then known as Teadra (I'm saving that nugget for later).</p>
        
        <h2>Ch 26 - Sallie Daera</h2>
        <p>Everytime I see this word now I think of Solidarity. Not sure if that has any implications. Okay whoa! WE HAVE MADE IT TO SALIDAR! I am happy to see all these Aes Sedai and Warders are safe and sound. That is great! Oh no Logain. I don’t know why I thought anything could be helped with Logain. I don’t think this is the last we see from Logain - I think we might be expected to believe he might be close to killing himself. I just don’t know.</p>
        
        <p>Maybe I’m too optimistic to see everyone safe and sound.</p>
        
        <h2>Ch 27 - The Practice of Diffidence</h2>
        <p>WHO IS GOING TO BE THE NEW AMYRLIN?! Who could they choose? I kinda hope it'll be Rand.. but I don't think that'll be the case at all. Maybe they're thinking Egwene???? Here's hoping! I really enjoyed this chapter. Lots of Politicing. Also, Bryne caught up! HERE WE GO!</p>
        
        <h2>Ch 28 - Trapped</h2>
        <p>GARYTH BRYNE IS AWESOME. Okay, he knows about Siuan now with her being stilled. I appreciate him. I think. He’s really smart and I’m super excited for what is going to happen now. Okay Aes Sedai agelessness. I still don’t know what it comes from and am now confused. So my imagination was Siuan would be like (let’s say..) 100 years old. She would look 50 (or something) with no wrinkles and things like that. But from what I’m reading it seems like the agelessness is going away from Siuan since she’s been stilled but she seems to be looking younger??  Crazy</p>
        
        <p>Min! Okay wow. I’m terrified of Logain. And this viewing of Bryne. Bull ripping roses off its neck. That’s clearly his allegiance with Morgase, but that makes no sense! Also Siuan has something to do with it. Hmmmmmm. Also, everyone just needs to chill out and let the Wheel Weave its Pattern. Everyone getting upset over situations that occur from things they themselves create… gotta calm down!</p>
        
        <h2>Ch 29 - Memories of Saldea</h2>
        <p>Holy crap. Holy crap. That was insane. Kadere murdering Isendre. Holy crap. That was crazy! Okay, so was this the first full on mention of “making love” in the series. Wow. And for it to be forced by a Darkfriend to get information. Good grief. Holy crap.</p>
        
        <h2>Ch 30 - A Wager</h2>
        <p>I'll wager this: I don't think we are going to see Perrin, Faile, Loial, or that crew this book. That's interesting.. I'll also wager that I have no idea what is going to happen for the rest of this book. SO MUCH COULD HAPPEN! This was a nice chapter, if not a little weird. I'm confused, but I think I get it. People in Cairhien came to Rand (with the help of some Aiel) and now they're going back to Cairhien to then come back to Rand and report? Right? Okay, sounds good.</p>
        
        <p>Also, Rand is rich.</p>
        
        <h2>Ch 31 - The Far Snows</h2>
        <p>Oh my my my *blushing face*. haha! Wow RJ. This was absolutely beautiful. Completely amazing. So cool to see this in the perspective of the Wheel of Time and the magic system. This was so much better because we've had so many books being built up with the embarassment of nakedness and such. That has been hounded to us about that and then we get this piece of Aviendha trying to wash like Rand has. Oh so beautiful. AND THEN AVIENDHA TRAVELS?! WOW WOW WOW! As soon as Aviendha Travelled and went running and then fell into the water.. oh my. I certainly thought she was going to die. This was it for me. I thought Rand was going to have to come back and try to communicate what happened. I was preparing myself.</p>
            
        <p>And then... wink, we did not get that! SO COOL that Rand could build an igloo with the Power, that's awesome! And how beautiful was this chapter written?? So beautiful.</p>
        
        <p>And preditiction: Rand and Aviendha will marry. Somehow.. not sure whose customs they'll follow. But they will!</p>
        
        <p>So cute.</p>
