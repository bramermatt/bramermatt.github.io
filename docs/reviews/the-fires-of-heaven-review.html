    <p>I'm really happy to be back reading the Wheel of Time. Make sure to check out my <a href="../../html/reviews/franchise/wheel-of-time-in-review.html">Wheel of Time in Review</a>!</p>

    <div class="two-thirds-img-columns">
        <div>
            <p>I am currently reading, as of April 8, 2023, and I'm no where near being done - so this is going to be a review in progress! And below, I'm going to have notes as I read, by chapter. More than likely spoilers, so I'm going to keep those hidden by the box below. When I've finished my read, the Notes box will be moved below the spoiler box, probably past the score!</p>

    <!-- <h2>Review Score</h2>
    <p>I'm trying a new way of reviewing, by implementing a new way to review - using a format taken from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@2ToRamble" target="_blank">2toRamble</a>! <em>And that’s the system! Rate those 5 categories out of 10, average your score, and that’s your /10 Rambler Rating! You can rate each category to the nearest hundredth, tenth, whole number, or whatever you please.</em></p>
        
    <p>This comes out to a total score of 5! An incredible book!</p> -->

        <summary style="background-color:rgb(27, 86, 105);">Notes As I Read</summary>

        <h2>Prologue - The First Sparks Fall</h2>
        <p>Back into the Wheel of Time... HERE WE GO! This Prologue was huge! Elaida as Amarylin.. this is incredible to see - I'm terrified to see what happens with Elaida. I'm really interested in these paintings that Elaida has on the wall. I'm also interested in learning about all the Blues not being there anymore. Is it true that really ALL THE BLUE AJAH are gone?</p>

        <p>Padan Fain MADE IT TO THE WHITE TOWER?! That was fast. Two months.. interesting.</p>

        <p>RHAVIN, Lanfear, Sammael, and Grandael.. THIS WAS AMAZING! I'm so excited to learn more about the Chosen and so much about their plans. This is facinating, really. I'm really glad to see the getting the information we've gotten so far of the Chosen. SO GOOD.</p>


        <h2>Fanning the Sparks</h2>
        <p>MIN - Oh this was nice! I'm really glad to be back with Min, Siuan, and Leane. THIS IS SO GOOD. I'm happy to see Logain helping the girls (I don't even know what to call them right now..). This is good.</p>

        <p>GARETH BRYNE - I like this. I really like Gareth Bryne.</p>

        <p>ALTEIMA - OH MY MY MY! Gaebril / Rhavin... whoa - it is crazy to see Compulsion happening on the other end. Wow. Scary.</p>

        <p>MORGASE - And Morgase misses Bryne.. aw.</p>

        <h2>Ch 2 - Rhuidean</h2>
        <p>HOLY SMOKES. Everything is so good here. So deep. There is so much good stuff here. So much of the Aiel - so much of Rhuidean. SO MUCH GOOD STUFF. Beautiful writing by Jordan, beautiful worldbuilding by Jordan... so so good. I can't believe we are learning so much so early - that's just my thoughts even though I'm in book five.. it's just so good. I'm so happy.</p>

        <p>Now, about this talk of LTT's Hundred Companions.. I want a full page of names of these companions in one really long sentence - I'm sure RJ could do that! I don't know I just really like the idea of having these named characters for this story of LTT and his Hundred Companions.</p>

        <p>Now, I love the descriptions of sadin and saidar.. beautiful. Also, it is very fascinating that Rand can feel when Moraine and/or Egwene are embracing saidar but he doesn't know who. I wonder if that ability will ever be found.</p>

        <p>Also also, LTT in Rand's head... AWESOME. So much in just the second chapter of this book.. gets me hyped up for the rest of the book!</p>


        <h2>Ch 3 - Pale Shadows</h2>
        <p>I love this chapter. I'm so happy.</p>

        <p>RAND - YES YES YES. Rand + ASMO. YES YES YES.</p>

        <p>I love the way Rand and Asmodean communicate. I am happy that Rand is getting so powerful - this is good!</p>

        <p>MAT - oh Mat, you're awesome. This is so much fun. I'm really happy to be reading these Mat perspectives.... SO GOOD! Mat is awesome. I love this Melindhra as well wink - that was awesome. And I really appreciate Mat trying to get Rand's attention.</p>

        <p>Also, next chapter.. we are still with Rand... YES!</p>

        <h2>Ch 4 - Twilight</h2>
        <p>So good.. Rand is jealous hmm. This is really interesting about Isandre and Rand having to hide that she and Kadere are Darkfriends.</p>

        <h2>CH 5 - Among the Wise Ones</h2>
        <p>I love this. I really haven't been too blown away by Egwene chapters. I just am so excited to read Rand and Mat chapters. But this was a good one. I feel like I really like where Egwene is at in her power, character arc, and everything about her. I hope she goes far in the series - I'm sure she might. But I'm really interested in TAR.</p>

        <p>What the heck is the bleakness?! ... I typed this and then listened to podcast ep 504 on this chapter. I think I understand it now.</p>

        <p>I'm still confused on the Aiel customs, of course. So, Melaine isn't married? but Dorindha is married to Bael? And she wants to marry them?</p>

        <p>And Isendre... what is going on here?! Also, Lanfear / Keille.. is she just gone?</p>

        <h2>Ch 6 - Gateways</h2>
        <p>Well this was awesome. Rand and the Darkhounds.. Mat with Melindhra, what is with this foxhead medallion - does that have something to do with... OH! Mat asked to not have anything to do to deal with Aes Sedai. So with the foxhead medallion - is that where Moiraines Healing was focused on?? HMM I HAVE NO IDEA! Reading on!</p>

        <p>Okay I need to compose my thoughts here. Good GRIEF. I am sitting in my work break room trying to keep myself from jumping up and down. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE. WOW WOW WOW.</p>

        <h2>Predictions as of Chapter 6</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Rand will absolutely be able to raise the dead (I have no idea how yet)</li>

        <li>Rand is literally insanely powerful.. that’s the prediction lol</li>
    </ul>
        <p>These books are going to be so jam packed with world building and magic - I can’t even imagine what the later books are going to be like. This is so good.</p>

        <p>Let me talk about Balefire.. WHAT?! IT REMOVES THINGS FROM THE PATTERN.. also thank you Brett for your help on the podcast (wow!). I am really interested in how this Balefire works....</p>

        <h2>Ch 7 - A Departure</h2>
        <p>Hey, whoever said someone clomping around on a horse describing people and their thoughts weren't fun.. have not read this chapter! WHOA. This was great! I really liked this chapter and I'm sure there is an incredible amount of detail that I missed about all the things that Egwene said - but I'm excited to hear how the Ogier are going to rebuild Rhuidean.. that's awesome! I love this Mat / Melindhra duo.. cute lol. And Rand's "until I return.. think of me.." water out of everywhere in Rhuidean.. so cool.</p>

        <p>Now Moiraine.. hmm, she's great. I love seeing her perspectives. Also, is she great?! I'm worried about her. I feel like she is going to die out of nowhere and no one is going to be able to stop it. I'm worried because she is so one-track mind.. and that's the Dragon Reborn fulfilling prophesies, but it just scares me. I don't want her to die. I appreciate her giving Rand her Oath to help her, and I appreciate the openness of all of that, but we'll see. hmm.</p>

        <p>Love this book so far.</p>

        <h2>Ch 8 - Over the Border</h2>
        <p>OOOOOO a Nynaeve perspective.. happy Matt!</p>

        <p>Oh boy, oh boy. This just makes me happy. I'm really glad to have gotten this insight into Nynaeve, Elayne, Thom, and Juilin. I do love their group and how they interact. Let me tell you, all these people *trying* to go to Tar Valon... that is going to be **bad**. I am so scared for all these people on their way.</p>

        <p>Also, Whitecloaks = scary! Dumb, but SCARY! Almost.. like Storm troopers? Is that something Brett has said before, still scary.</p>

        <p>I do love this book so far.</p>

        <h2>Ch 9 - A Signal</h2>
        <p>I mean come on girls… good grief. Why would you drink tea from someone you don’t know who also ISNT DRINKING THE TEA THEMSELVES!</p>

        <p>Also prediction: Nynaeve will overcome this being angry to channel (and I think Mogi helped her inadvertently realize what the issue was - that Nynaeve is scared.. right?) but she will overcome it! That’s my hope!</p>

        <h2>Ch 10 - Figs and Mice</h2>
        <p>I tell you what, I can't even begin to think about where all these pigeons are going. Of course, one is going to Tar Valon, but I have no idea where the other two exact copies are going.</p>

        <p>I am also very happy we get Nynaeve saying "thank you" to Thom and Juilin.. also IS NYNAEVE GOING TO BE A YELLOW AJAH?! WOW! I am interested in Elayne with Black Hair.. I can imagine there is going to be some changes in her life when she comes back into contact with people who know her with her reddish hair. Interesting!</p>

        <p>Loving this so far.</p>

        
        <h2>Ch 11 - The Nine Horse Hitch</h2>
        <p>Back with Siuan, Leane, Min, and Logain! Okay - I'm liking what I'm seeing here. I love being in Siuan's perspective. Siuan is awesome. I'm really enjoying these eyes-and-ears.. we're getting a lot out of this from these recent chapters, but I'm interested in more! Min is great too. I just feel worried about what is going to happen next for this crew. I'm worried that something is going to be bad and I'm just worried. Here we go!</p>
        
        <p>
        Ch 12
        An Old Pipe
        I mean is there anyone not to like in these books really? I feel for Bryne. I feel for him in his current predicament and for all he’s had to go through and for all that he is going to try to do. I like him a lot! I’m continuing my worry for Siuan, Min, Leane, and Logain. What is going to happen?! 
        
        Ch 13
        A Small Room in Sienda
        Okay, first off.. where is Perrin, Faile, Gaul, Bain, Chiad, Loial - where are they all?! We haven't heard anything from them the entire book!
        
        Okay, let's talk about this chapter... Okay so we're about to get some TAR.. SWEET! And My guess is possibly that this group and Siuan's group will be close to each other?? I think - if the map loosk right.. idk. Otherwise, I'm enjoying this!
        
        Ch 14
        Meetings
        Oh Nynaeve.. Okay let's get into it! Wow. I love this chapter. We get Birgitte in TAR and more info about Forsaken + Heroes in TAR and that Gaidal Cain has been born again.. wow. Great stuff! Learning about Mogi's name in the Old Tongue gets me excited to learn what Lanfear means haha!
        
        OH THE PRESCRIPTS! WHO HAS IMPLIMENTED THOSE. HOW DO THEY WORK?!
        
        Okay, Egwene and Melaine with Nynaeve. Hmm. Nynaeve is about to burst! And as this chapter ends... good grief Nynaeve - she is going to get herself in big trouble.
        
        Ch 15
        What Can Be Learned in Dreams
        I am glad Egwene and Nynaeve finally know that Elaida is Amyrlin! Man I felt like a friend in an awkward conversation with two lifelong friends with the conversation between Egwene and Nynaeve. I mean it was difficult to read since I felt for Nynaeve but Egwene was GOING OFF on Nynaeve. 
        
        I also hope to see the Blues that are left. I can't believe that they're all dead. I just hope they're safe.
        
        Now reading Egwene’s perspective! I LOVE WHEN EGWENE TALKS ABOUT HER DREAMS! YES!
        Okay, Rand sitting down in a chat - not his chair a woman's chair... OH WOW. THE AMYRLIN'S SEAT?! Is Rand going to sit in the Amyrlin's seat?? That's gotta be the seat.. right?
        Perrin and Faile - with the Manetheran Banner and the Wolf's head banner.. nice. And the Tinker (ARAM), why does Egwene feel a chill of doom when he gets close to Perrin?? OH NO!
        Mat with his dice and wound.. hmm. Thom reaching in a fire to bring out the blue stone that is apparenlty on Moraine's forhead... WHAT?!?!?! Are Thom and Moiraine connected in some way or will be connected in some way??
        Lastly a storm with lightning bolts.. spooky.
        
        Oh this book is so enjoyable. In my lifetime, I've ridden a horse twice. And it was so incredible. This book is reinvigorating that love - oh wow I can just remember how it felt hopping up into the stirrups and galloping along. AHHHH SOO GOOD! 
        
        Okay... Egwene feeling close to choosing her Ajah! What in the world would she choose? I mean, I feel after this conversation she's looking very Blue to me. But really, I don't think I know of every Ajah in depth. Nynaeve, I feel, is looking for Yellow (healing). And Elayne has thought about Green (battle!), but I don't know if she will actually choose that. A lot is still up in the air! 
        
        LOVE THIS BOOK!
        
        Ch 16
        An Unexpected Offer
        AHHHHHH!!! If you can't tell I'm screaming. Whoa, this is crazy and exciting and I'm so down for it. We are getting more of this menagerie... I can't wait! Am I to understand that Thom and Juilin will go with them? 
        
        Okay, Galad. Wow. He is SCARY! At least what he can do is scary. And he says that Siuan has been stilled and executed! Nynaeve and Elayne are shaken... Thankfully we know that's not true. 
        
        Now let's talk Thom and Elayne...... I imagine a kiss is necessary but nothing more will come of it - that's my prediction. Thom will be the one to call it off. That's what I think. 
        
        Oh this is so good.
        
        Ch 17
        Heading West
        THE CIRCUS! Or the menagerie.. lol I’m excited. I love Valan Luca, I’m interested to see what his character does when paired with Nynaeve, Elayne, Thom, and Juilin - he seems quite the showman and I’m excited. 
        
        Oh oh the SEANCHAN! Yup that’s going to get wild I think. very interesting how subservient she’s acting… interesting. 
        
        Holy smokes.. ALUDRA! The Illuminator Mat and Thom met! 
        
        Onto a LIANDRIN perspective, WHAT?!
        
        Ch 18
        A Hound for Darkness
        Okay I was excited about a Loandrin perspective, and then Moghedien shows up?! Wow! A good and SCARY chapter. Wow. This is going to be good. I mean bad. I mean good. Oh this is going to be awesome! 
        
        I’m very worried about Nynaeve and Elayne now - this is going to be bad for them and I don’t want that. Wow, Moghedien is scary. 
        
        Okay, reading on!
        
        Ch 19
        Memories
        Okay, I did not expect a chapter with Morgase as the POV and Fain as the second POV to be my favorite chapter of this book so far but GOOD GRIEF. I also don't think that's true, but this chapter is up there with the earlier Rhuidean chapters... well really, this WHOLE BOOK IS AMAZING! Okay let's get into this...
         
        Wow, I was really feeling horrible for Morgase here - she's Compelled by Gaebril / Rhavin but not all the time and that's torture. Oh I felt so bad for her here. And then we get Tallanvor.. love him - he's such a good guy. Loves his Queen Morgase! WOO! And we get Lini! That's awesome. Love this. I love it all. And I'm really glad we get to see them all leave safely. I was really worried. So much awesome happened in Morgase's POV it almost couldn't have been topped.. and then we get a FAIN POV.. YES!
        
        Okay Fain.. Padan Fain, Mordeith, Master Fain.... WHOA. I mean talk about a plot bombshell here - Shayol Ghul and his experience with Shayol Ghul.. GOOD GRIEF. And Fain gets the dagger back and he kills Verine (accepted) and then Alviarin is Black Ajah (i'm too hyped up on this chapter to remember, but I think we definitely knew that already). But this talk of Thakan'dar... SO SO GOOD. SO SO GOOD.
        
        Also, Fain nicked himself, I don't guess that will be much an issue for him.. right?
        
        Ch 20
        Jangai Pass
        Shoot. This is good. I’m loving this Rand. He Who Comes With the Dawn and The Dragon Reborn looks good on Rand lol. He has such power and it’s just so cool. RJ is such a beautiful writer. I’m impressed! And now, this is getting rowdy. Couladin is crazy and I have literally no idea what to expect from him. What on earth is he going to do to Rand and these Aiel?! 
        
        Also, Mat is so good. So so good. 
        
        And wait wait! Is this the first we’ve gotten full written description of Laman’s Sin?? Whoa!</p>
