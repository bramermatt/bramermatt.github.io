    <p>If you don't want to see the spoilers, you won't see them. There is a clear break when spoilers begin and they are typically separated by a <strong style="color:red;">RED</strong> box with the words "Spoilers".</p>

        <h2>Prologue, The First Message</h2>
        <p>Good gracious. Not only do we get a Forsaken perspective - Demandred, we get more of Shayol Ghul, the Pit of Doom, Thakan’dar, HOLY SMOKES. We also get the GREAT LORD OF THE DARK TALKING TO DEMANDRED?! AHHHH! And how Thakan’dar blades are made… by murdering people?! Golly! AND THE BORE?! AND THAT THIS IS TODAY… A DAY AFTER FIRES OF HEAVEN! I AM FREAKING OUT!! This is amazing!! And Nae’blis… one step below the Great Lord huh? Interesting.</p>

        <p>Oh, and a Nynaeve perspective.. yay! Okay, a lot here. Nynaeve is working hard at figuring out how to Heal stilling and gentling, and she is justifiably weary of Healing Logain’s Gentling. Mogi was actually Marigan from the boat! Fascinating! Stilling is something that has been cut or torn (Severed as Mogi called it). And the weather huh? The Dark One’s doing.</p>

        <p>Next is an Elayne perspective. And boy, I like Elayne too... oh and Min! Hey, I knew Elayne was going to do something with the ter'angrael.. and she did! She was able to copy it from the a'dam! That's crazy awesome! I also love that they are learning things from Mogi (another teacher from the AOL!!). I appreciate Mogi being complicate, well as much as she can be since she's collared.. haha! But I look forward to seeing Min meet up with Rand. And what the heck is the Dark One doing with the weather!</p>

        <p>I don't know if I've said it yet... but I love Perrin, and I love Faile. I also love Loial. I'm happy about this crew. Oh this was a great perspective.. Faile! She's great! I appreciate that she is taking to this Lady business as Perrin doesn't want to be around. I love the fact that a lot of people are coming to the Two Rivers and Emond's Field. That's great! Oh and Perrin needs to go to Rand... YES! I can't wait. Are we going to get Min getting to Rand and Perrin getting to Rand this book?! I CAN'T WAIT! Interesting Verrin and Alanna are gone.. I guess they are going to Salidar? And wait.. is Alanna the Green that is bonded to Lan now?? I can't seem to remember. This is going to be a huge book.</p>

        <p>GAWYN NO! Dang it.. this peddler has started something that I am not looking forward to. I hate that Gawyn now wants to kill Rand when he's on his way with six Aes Sedai to capture Rand. This is not going to be good. I can smell it. Not good. My prediction is Rand won't be able to kill Gawyn but Gawyn will try to kill Rand, but the Maidens will kill Gawyn, and try explaining that to Elayne, Rand! OH THIS IS GOING TO STINK! Also, for note taking.. Corien is the "leader" of the Aes Sedai, and Elaida told him nothing. Gotta be a Black Ajah plot right?? Oh no! But, there were only six Aes Sedai.. we might be okay.. might be. And these sneaky Shaido Wise One's hmm..</p>

        <p>Katerine Alruddin, good gracious.. BLACK AJAH PLOT! There are so many people that want to kill Rand right now. OH NO. Okay, I have to put this in more for me than anything.. okay Aes Sedai agelessness again. "Galina Casban looked forty at most, but that was twice Katerine's true age". No thoughts, just adding it to my notes. This is getting deep knowing now that this group's mission was not Elaida's and this was completely Black Ajah plot! WHOA!</p>

        <p>Sevanna (COULADIN'S WIDOW).. this strange wetlander hmm. Forsaken, gotta be, or Fain. What's this box?? This Prologue is DEEP.</p>

        <p>MORGASE... PAITR IS A DARKFRIEND! I'm glad we're getting a Morgase perspective, and now she knows Gaebril/Rahvin is dead. Will she be going to Ghealdan like Tallanvor wants? Who knows.</p>

        <p>Pedron Niall, a sneaky Sonofagun.. And we get Carridin.. sorry, Bors! Not looking good. Now this Guaire Amalasan, interesting Worldbuilding. Niall doesn't want any Children to go to Salidar. Okay, onto the next!</p>

        <p>Masaana the Forsaken! YES! I love it when we get Forsaken in cahoots! I find it.. interesting, that when Masaana went to the Pit of Doom the ceiling was shorter - so that it brushed her hair. Maybe this is insignificant, but maybe it's not. And interesting that the DO didn't say anything to her. AND interesting that these Forsaken are looking for angreal and sa'angreal AND interesting about this Statis Box.. what the heck is that?! AND THAT HAS THE BE THE BOX THAT SEVANNA HAS, AND THAT HAS TO HAVE BEEN A FORSAKEN THAT GAVE THE BOX TO SEVANNA! Also, who is the Lord of Chaos?!</p>

        <p>Osan'gar / Aran'gar.. pardon me.. what? Is this one person or two?! This raises so many questions.. why can't men touch Saidar? why can't women touch Saidin? Could this amalgamation of a human touch both halves? what the heck is this thing?? And we get Shaidar Haran again... interesting.</p>

        <h2>Ch 1, Lion on the Hill</h2>
        <p>A wind rises in Cairhien. Alright, this is good. Rand is hearing more and more of LTT in his head.. I WANT MORE OF THAT!! Alright, Egwene is in Cairhien. Rand is still in Caemlyn. Rand has a plan to take Illian, plan from Mat + Bashere, but of course more Mat than Bashere! This is so good. ALso, Bashere's nine thousand horses includes nobles and officers AND THEIR WIVES... I definitely think Faile will want to go with Perrin everywhere - because this is Saldaen culture. And lastly.. we get Mazrim Taim entering the Palace.. WHOA!</p>

        <h2>Ch 2, A New Arrival</h2>
        <p>Mazrim Taim.. man I feel exactly as Rand does here. I'm worried not to trust Taim. And it is quite possibly because Rand isn't the only male channeler. But Rand needs help, or at least he will for the Last Battle. I just don't know. Getting some funny feelings from Taim. I appreciate there is a name for Rand's Seanchan spear.. The Dragon Scepter. And where is Rand going to take Taim?? lol</p>

        <p>Also, anyone going to mention Asmodean?</p>

        <h2>Ch 3, A Woman's Eyes</h2>
        <p>I love this. 27 possible male channellers in the few weeks since Rand has called for them. That's good. Feels like a very insignificant number. I hope more come and I expect more to come as well. Not sure how, but I'm sure there might! Rand is pretty strong. I so badly want to trust Taim. And YES! We get Rand thinking that Asmo fled - glad it's been acknowledged. And LTT, whatcha doin' in there? And Taim can hold as much as Rand can.. well well well. Interesting. I want Rand to be the most powerful and I have heard he is.. I'm just really jealous that someone might be close to Rand in power. AHH TAIM! Also, I love Rand opening gateways!</p>

        <h2>Ch 4, A Sense of Humor</h2>
        <p>I am so interested in Aiel humor lol. I don't get it at all, and I hope I do one day. Alright so we've got Hearne, Simaan, Darlin, Tedosian, and Estanda rebelling against Rand and have gone to Haddon Mirk. I appreciate that Rand is choosing to ignore that for now.. that's for future Rand. Rand has a lot on his plate! Also, Rand being called Lord of the Morning.. nice! And Rand hasn't heard LTT since he told him to "shut up". I find that....... interesting. I will keep an eye out for that. Also, Rand has been using TAR!</p>

        <h2>Ch 5, A Different Dance</h2>
        <p>SHEESH. I. LOVE. MAT. This is so great. Alright, a lot here in 30+ pages. Mat and the BAND OF THE RED HAND, that is freaking awesome. I love Mat. I am so interested in Mat's memories and Mat's Luck. so much of that is barely explained, and I'm so read to learn more. I really think it's awesome that Mat is Mat. He is like no other main character here. I am interested in what the Horn means to / for Mat now, just a lot has happened and he doesn't have it, and he died. So is it still linked to it? I love Mat and Betse, that's sweet. I'm interested to know why Mat has memories when dancing... interesting. Also, anytime any character cares for someone less fortunate puts me in my feels, Mat and Olver is great. It makes me very happy. AND Mat and the Red Hand moving to Tear.. interesting, is there just going to be an absolutely massive army to attack Sammael in Illian? That'd be neat.</p>

        <h2>Ch 6, Threads Woven of Shadow</h2>
        <p>Before I read... this is my new favorite chapter symbol and chapter title. Without a doubt, I'm here for it! WOO! Sammael, are you my favorite Forsaken? Interesting. This was an awesome perspective. I love seeing the Forsaken interact and I'm so interested in all these Old-Tongue words: jegal, choss-hauler, conje. Also, is Graendal talking about Shara?! That's pretty neat. I'm going to write these words down to remember.. Sh'boan, Sh'botay. I find it interesting that Sammael won't call Rand LTT.. why? Here we go! And the ILLUSION! That's the holding of the image when Graendal was using to make herself look different. Very interesting.</p>

        <p>Graendal.. golly. She’s cunning and smart. Lady Basene. Okay, I have no idea who that is. I’m sure we’ll find out! Very interesting - this whole thing. And what has Mesaana bound? Semirhage?</p>

        <p>And Semirhage.. she scares me. She seems so smart and so ready to be able to do SOME HARM. And yes, I believe the other Forsaken also very bad, but these Forsaken that we've recently heard from are just very scary. And let's talk a bit here. Shaidar Haran, I'm with Semirhage - what is he?? WHY IS HE SO DIFFERENT. Also, interesting that the Forsaken don't understand the Warder bond. And Semi has killed the Warder. And this Aes Sedai is Cabriana Mecandes. Okay. I will continue to say Lanfear and Moiraine are not dead.</p>

        <h2>Ch 7, A Matter of Thought</h2>
        <p>TAR. Hey, I'm a happy Matt here, but I'm also a little confused. But I think I get it. So, someone dreamed this nightmare and it became real. Someone stepped into it and was sucked in. But to get rid of the nightmare, the Aes Sedai had to concentrate on what was real. FASCINATING. Alright, we're back with Elayne, Nynaeve, and the Salidar crew. Cool. A lot of info in this chapter, catching us up on the bits and bobs of Randland. I do have a prediction: is Shemerin... Mesaana? The Accepted that fled? Because the Dark One called her back to Shayol Ghul? That's my prediction! And whoa, Demandred knows that Elayne is Elayne and that she is using a mirror ter'angreal. That's a lot. WHO IS THE LORD OF CHAOS?!</p>

        <h2>Ch 8, The Storm Gathers</h2>
        <p>First off, title of the chapter... the Storm Gathers... kinda like The Gathering Storm?? Huh?? Book 12?? huh?? Anyways lol.</p>
        <p>I. LOVE. NYNAEVE. I have said it before, and I will continue saying it. I love Nynaeve. My love for her started in the Eye of the World, because I thought of her as a bit of a Hagrid Character (sorry for the shot for the Harry Potter reference), but I thought of her as a bit of a terciary character that I enjoyed being around, and then as her character grew I really really enjoyed reading her. My love for her was brought up 10-fold when she got Birgitte brought into the real world. When she was crying and sad and hurt so much for doing that - that's when I knew I loved Nynaeve. I want nothing more than to see Nynaeve happy and doing anything she puts her mind to. I want that for Nynaeve. I don't care how she gets that - I want that for her. I love her.</p>

        <p>Also, I love that RJ capitalizes Listening to the Wind.. so good. Alright, let's try to figure this all out - there was a lot in these 27 pages. I appreciate Theodrin and her wanting to help Nynaeve with her block - me too Theodrin.. me too. But I thought that was an endearing story and I can safely say I don't think that Theodrin is a darkfriend - there was a thought of that, but now I'm fully on board with her not being a darkfriend.</p>

        <p>Salidar is packed. Good. I appreciate that the Aes Sedai are recruiting! WOOP! MORE NOVICES IN SALIDAR THAN IN THE TOWER.. WOOP!</p>

        <p>Oh boy, Tarna Feir of the Red Ajah from the WHITE TOWER... OH BOY!</p>

        <p>I'm tucking away Nynaeve's sense of the bad weather lasting for days. I'll keep that in mind... hmm. I LOVE NYNAEVE!</p>

        <h2>Ch 9, Plans, White Cloak Sunburst</h2>
        <p>Alrighty, Pedron Niall, I've said it before and I'll say it again.. Pedron Niall, is a sneaky Sonofagun. He is ruthless and has a lot of power behind him. I really enjoy seeing his perspective but he has a lot of agents at his disposal to do some damage! Things could get rough. The Four Rumors.. 1. Black Ajah started the upheaval of the White Tower. 2. Black Ajah have control of the White Tower. 3,4. Aes Sedai in Salidar are petiioning for forgiveness and denouncing themselves as Aes Sedai. Interesting.</p>


        <h2>Ch 10, A Saying in the Borderlands, The Dragon Icon</h2>
        <p>RAND HAS BEEN BONDED?! BY ALANNA?! Golly. I have zero idea what that is going to mean for Rand + Elayne + Alanna. How can Rand break this bond? Does Rand need to break the bond? Is this a good thing? Why did she do this?! Dude. This is crazy. Also, Rand is super t'avaren and so much is happening around him. WHAT DOES THIS BONDING MEAN?! Also, Rand figured out how not to be hot lol.</p>

        <h2>Ch 11, Lessons and Teachers, Dragon Fang Icon</h2>
        <p>Okay, so that's how Moiraine made herself look gigantic in TEOTW.. Air and Fire in an Illusion! I've been wondering that since then! How did she do it! And okay, I do not at all give any aquiecense to Alanna here, because she bonded Rand against his will. Even if her Warder died, she had no right. Maybe she was being selfish, but she sounds a lot like a Red with "men channelers loose on the world?! NO WAY!". I do not like Alanna.</p>

        <h2>Ch 12, Questions and Answers, Tar Valon Icon</h2>
        <p>Neither saw the woman watching them from a second-story window. Spooky. </p>

        <p>Oh my Nynaeve. I don't like how Mogi is putting in thoughts in Nynaeve's head.. at one point literally says "Moghedien was right."... NOT GOOD NYNAEVE. I don't know if Nynaeve, Elayne, and Birgitte are going to leave Salidar. That's interesting. I can't believe that they'd be able to leave without being noticed. That isn't going to be good for them. Thom and Juilin still aren't back.. hmm. Delana and Janya are questioning Nynaeve on Rand - I recently feel like everyone wants to trap Rand. At least in these last two chapters, Aes Sedai want Rand and they want him badly.</p>

        <p>For this eavesdropping stopping ward is... Fire + Air with touches of Water. Neat!</p>

        <h2>Ch 13, Under the Dust, Snake Icon</h2>
        <p>First off, why the Snake icon?? Is it because something is going to happen in Ebou Dar?? I don't know! Honestly, I thought this chapter was going to be Nynaeve breaking her block! I want that so badly. Nynaeve keeps saying "Moghedien is right".. I don't like that! That shouldn't be the case, Mogi is bad news! How would this crew go to Caemlyn unnoticed? And this Tarna... hmm... she has me thinking..</p>

        <p>Let's talk TAR! Alright. Love the *shift*! Also love this *Need* in TAR. Very interesting. I'm interested in this weather ter'angreal! I wonder if this would be able to control the weather EVERYWHERE! Probably not lol. It is 2 feet across, but I just don't know! I also love Elayne thinking she knows everything about everywhere they go.. "you'd like the Ebou Dari Wise Women Nynaeve.." lol.</p>

        <h2>Ch 14, Dreams and Nightmares, Dreams Icon</h2>
        <p>I feel Egwene in this chapter, not knowing is tough! Not knowing when you desprately want to know.. that's tough. I feel for you Egwene. You're silly for this whole chapter, absolute a silly Dreamer here thinking you can go around TAR and not have any consequences. Who are these women.. A copper skinned woman in Tar Valon, and a handsome woman in the White Tower and the Heart of the Stone AND in Caemlyn. Who could it be?! Heck.. Brett and Dani in podcast ep. 609. These women are Siuan and Leane.. duh lol. She doesn’t recognize them because of the agelessness!</p>

        <p>Let's talk Gawyn. What just happened?! So this is Gawyn's dream. Okay, why did it pull Egwene in? Maybe if someone dreams of YOU and you're in TAR or with the lights, whosever dream is dreaming of you, you get pulled in? That sounds a bit farfetched, but I wouldn't be surprised. And they definitely made love. But WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IN TAR?! WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?!</p>

        <p>Now onto Nynaeve's perspective. Oh wow.. that was interesting! A bubble of evil eh?? Very interesting that Anaiya doesn't believe about the bubble of evil and why she requested a Linking?? And she was disappointed that this wasn't a Forsaken attack.. INTERESTING!</p>

        <h2>Ch 15, A Pile of Sand, Aiel Icon</h2>
        <p>Oh Egwene, your dreams mean so much! Don't think so little of them! Of course, I have no real idea what they mean either, right now, but they mean a lot you DREAMER! Since Lanfear's attack Egwene has headaches after visiting TAR.. does that have something to do with Lanfear's connection with TAR? Or could it be just the part of the brain or the power (lowercased p) that Dreamers have or those Dreamwalkers have to enter TAR could be injured or severed in some way? Like, could Egwene lose the ability to enter TAR if she were "injured" more? HMMM. Okay, so let's talk these dreams..</p>

        <p>Gawyn shutting a door on Egwene and she was dead.. I'm writing that down to look back on that one. I imagine Egwene might die at somepoint. But at this point we've seen people die and they're able to come back so.. we'll see! Perrin and the wolf and hawk and falcon... Berelain and Faile! Mat with two ravens on his shoulders... interesting. Elayne forcing Rand to his knees with one hand.. bonding? - can multiple people bond the same person???? Elayne, Min, and Aviendha in a circle around Rand... oh oh! And Rand walking toward a burning mountain (Shayol Ghul), crunching the Seals! THIS ONE I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE PLAYOUT! Egwene, stop lying to the Wise Ones. Also, I am soooo interested in the ages of Aes Sedai!</p>

        <p>Nynaeve.. THAT WAS AWESOME! Silly, but that was AWESOME! Way to bring it to the Little Tower where it hurts them, their fear. I mean, it's true. They're scared and they don't know otherwise. They think they know what to do, but when the going gets tough.. they've got nothing! Oh that was awesome. Silly, she's absolutely going to regret that, but awesome. And this ter'angreal needs a man to channel - ah but it was a lie. so, okay.</p>

        <p>Elayne.. haha I love that line "Elayne sneezed, banging her head on the side of the overturned caldron", what a line after Nynaeve's outburst. And Elayne swears that she will go to Ebou Dar, find the ter'angreal and use it to tie the Salidar Aes Sedai to Rand. Number 1, I have no idea how, but I'm here for it!</p>

        <p>And lastly Sheriam, what does Carlinya mean that less than two dozen Aes Sedai know what is really going on.. going on about what??</p>

        <h2>Ch 16, Tellings of the Wheel, Forsaken Icon</h2>
        <p>Dear Lord. THIS IS GOING TO BE A GOOD BOOK! I keep going back and forth on this statement.. this has been my favorite chapter of the book so far. Maybe it was the realization of Rand's parents after so much build up from TEOTW.. so good to see Rand hear it from Dyelin. I truly didn't think we were going to get that yet, but there it was and WOW. To see it written is absolutely amazing! SO GOOD! Makes me want to reread TEOTW again.. lol I surely will. Also, makes me want to reread TEOTW for Moiraine.. oh Moiraine, I miss you! My prediction has been and will stay: she's not dead. I don't know when we'll see her next, but she's not dead! THIS WAS SO GOOD. Also, isn't Moriaine Damodred? So, just for my sanity.. we've got DAD - Taringail Damodred, MOM - Tigraine (daughter heir.. last name unknown to me) / Shaiel... children - Rand and Galad. So Moiraine is related to Taringail? Or maybe I'll RAFO and hey, I'm happy to RAFO! But Laman was also a Damodred.... whoa. A lot. I love this chapter. I love this book. I love this book series. WHOA! HERE WE GO!</p>

        <p>Also, yes Rand, DO NOT TRUCE A FORSAKEN! And wink wink, Aviendha biting her lip thinking of Rand. And Rand is putting off "watching the cavalry". Okay. NEXT!!</p>

        <h2>Ch 17, The Wheel of a Life, Dragon Icon</h2>
        <p>Good gracious.. MANGIN. That was so hard to read. He knew he did wrong, did it anyway, and came clean. That is powerful and hard and sad. Oh Rand. That was tough. Where did Avihenda go?? Very interesting these Cairhienin people attempting to twist Aiel ways. I appreciate where Rhuarc is coming from. And I don’t agree with Berelain (I DO NOT LIKE HER). Not that I don’t trust her, I just don’t like her. Oh oh Shara! Fighting in Shara! What’s going on with the Sea Folk?? Hmmm.</p>

        <h2>Ch 18, A Taste of Solitude, Cairhienin Icon</h2>
        <p>Rand orders Berelain and Rhuarc to hang Mangin tomorrow, then he leaves for his school. This is great! So cool. Getting to see all these things that we know of in our world being made here... so cool! Alright, I love this Herid Fel fella. Really interesting stuff about the Last Battle and the Wheel of Time. This is great! And the chapter isn't even over! I think I might need to nail down some predictions about what the Last Battle will be.</p>

        <p>Um Egwene.. you're being judgmental. Lol. I just feel like Egwene thinks she's so much better than everyone else. It's odd to see her and Rand interact now. I don't like when she's angry with him lol. I like to see this ta'veren pull on people, I see how hard it could be for people to realize what's happening for the pull. I agree, what are these Salidar Aes Sedai not coming to Rand? What will happen if Rand knows where Salidar is?</p>

        <p>Oh heck, Rand, this is going to go poorly for you, letting the Maiden's by the wayside just so you can have some solitude. THIS WILL BE BAD FOR YOU!</p>

        <h2>Ch 19, Matters of Toh, Caemlyn Lion Icon</h2>
        <p>Hey, cool! I love these bits of AOL with the sho-wings and cars. They're cool. Although, very interesting that Rand is seemingly having LTT's dreams now? That doesn't sound like that is a good thing... I'll have to RAFO! Interesting dreams these Wise Ones have. Rand on a boat with three women (Elayne, Min, and Aviendha I'm guessing) or maybe its Alanna and some others... interesting. And a scale titling hmm.. Maybe I agree with Rand on his interpretations of these dreams, I like to see people say their interpretations whether or not I agree with them. It's helpful to have a starting point on making sense of these prophetic dreams. And Rand telling LTT to shut up again.. hmm.</p>

        <p>Aviendha.. oh Aviendha. I love that she was able to hand-talk with Liah with "I have toh" and she replies "very small, spear-sister"... ahhh so sweet. I love it! And what the heck is this about killing Rand??? Can anyone explain without spoilers lol?</p>

        <h2>Ch 20, From the Stedding, Avendasora(?) Leaf Icon</h2>
        <p>I have so many thoughts. Oh, do I love the Ogier. I love them so much. They are perfect. I want to spend so much time with them and learn so much more of how they work! This was a beautiful chapter. I felt so much when Elder Haman was marking the Groves and Steddings of those they lost... so sad. This was awesome - finding out about more Steddings and Waygates! I look forward to a *safe* Waygate travel.. with no Black Wind... spooky. </p>

        <p>Question: Will we get an updated World Map at the beginning of A Crown of Swords with the Steddings or no? I'm really interested in that actually.</p>

        <p>OH BOY WE ARE GOING BACK TO SHADAR LOGOTH! I'M SO EXCITED! THIS IS GOING TO BE TERRIFYING! </p>

        <p>Questions: Are they going to Gateway there, or is Rand just Travelling now, capital T? Because he technically *knows* where he is at. But the Skimming is when you ride through the Gateway and it takes a while, Travelling is walkthrough and you're there right?</p> 

        <h2>Ch 21, To Shadar Logoth, Ravens Icon</h2>
        <p>This book, specifically these recent chapters, have been such a nostalgic ride from everything we've learned so far since TEOTW. SO MANY FEELS! How did Liah die? Or did she even die?</p>

        <p>Interesting about LTT talking in Rands head.. how they can almost communicate. I would **hate** this, because this wouldn't be what I want at all. If LTT really wasn't communicating with Rand and this is just Rand going mad from the taint on saidin. The idea that LTT isn't actually in Rand's head, that's what I **don't** want. I **want** LTT to be in Rand's head. I don't konw how that works or why that's something that I want, but I want that to be true, that somehow and someway Rand will be able to communicate with LTT. That is what I want.</p>

        <p>Oh Rand nearly back to Emond's Field.. sad. I miss Loial.</p>

        <h2>Ch 22, Heading South, Dice (Mat) Icon</h2>
        <p>HERE WE GO! This was great! I love when Mat gets to fight with his staff - he's great at it! Now, really, some Aiel killed these Tinker's? And this was a Forsaken that sent these Aiel... but who. I really don't know, because all these Forsaken are against each other some trying to pretend that Sammael sent seom Aiel when it was actually another.. I'll be interested to find out who actually sent these.. And Olver is here, now being Mat's Messenger! And he gets his own horse! THIS IS SO GOOD.</p>

        <h2>Ch 23, To Understand a Message, Forsaken Icon</h2>
        <p>Graendal and Sammael..nice. Sammael seems to think he is going to have a statis box (box from AOL) and he thinks there are angreal there too. UH OH! So he thinks Rand accepted the Truce? I do believe he was lying. Interesting that this jumara / Worms in the Blight. Mesaana in the White Tower. Graendal doesn't know where Demandred or Semirhage are. I think Semirhage is still at Shayol Ghul? Short chapter.</p>

        <h2>Ch 24, An Embassy, The Flame of Tar Valon Icon</h2>
        <p>Mangin was hanged off screen. Okay, so that happened. I trusted it would, because I know Rand and those he has put in commanding positions are true to their word. Sucks it was Mangin, but it happened. Egwene is told she can return to TAR, even though she has been without anyone's permission. There are a lot of rumors about the Aes Sedai splitting. And then five or six Aes Sedai come to greet Rand, these Aes Sedai are believed to be from the White Tower Embassy. Rand isn't in Cairhien. Egwene runs to meet the Wise Ones and Berelain is there, so Berelain needs to go meet this embassy. Egwene goes back to her own tent, but is too tired to visit TAR (good you shouldn't yet!) and she ends up dreaming of Gawyn.</p>

        <h2>Ch 25, Like Lightning and Rain, Caemlyn Lion</h2>
        <p>Egwene's perspective.. boy do I love love for these characters. Everyone. Nynaeve and Lan.... ooooo where is Lan?? Is he close to Salidar? Perrin and Faile, love it. Rand and Elayne, love it. Rand and Aviendha, love it. Egwene and Gawyn, love love love it! Gawyn is such a sweet sap and it's so good to see, he really loves Egwene. And I love Egwene saying that she is going to Bond Gawyn. ALSO ALSO, Birgitte and Uno... love it! haha. Okay, so these Aes Sedai.. if I recall, these are BLACK AJAH right?? From the Prologue? hmm what are they channelling?</p>

        <p>Katerine, and Nesune perspecitves.. what the heck is going on?! Katerine is Black Ajah, BUT WHAT COULD SHE BE PLANNING?!. It is interesting that they have this plan that someone else will neeed to rule Cairhien... hmmmm.</p>

        <p>Lastly Sarene Nemdahl.. that's what the channeling is! The practicing with a lot of saidar! And there are more Aes Sedai coming to Cairhien! Aracome is still working Berelain... hmm..</p>

        <h2>Ch 26, Connecting Lines, Whitecloak Icon</h2>
        <p>Holy smokes this chapter blew up! First off, what the heck are Bashere's men doing? Why are they hand-standing on their horses? What are the white stones so close apart?? THEN HOLY SMOKES THESE PEOPLE TRY TO MURDER RAND IN DIRTY WHITECLOAK UNIFORMS?! And Desora is killed... so sad. And more Aiel dead too. These are, I believe just standard Darkfriends but their wearing Whitecloak uniforms that I cannot remember who those people were. And how Rand deals with these people is awesome. So powerful making the guy ride to Niall. Wow!</p>

        <p>Then back in the Palace a Wavemistress wants to talk to Rand, nice. I wonder what that’s all about. </p>

        <p>And then! Awesome Andor history that I look forward to Brett recapping for me in the podcast! But Rand is safe, he is not a cousin to Elayne.. 😂😂😂😂. So good. </p>

        <p>What’s in Cairhien, why would Rand go there??</p>
        
        <h2>Ch 27, Gifts, Dragon Icon</h2>
        <p>Egwene perspective. Hey, I’m glad we got some Aes Sedai talking with Rand! That was awesome to see. I appreciate Rand going at them with “do not channel near me, do not even embrace the True Source.” SO GOOD. So powerful, Rand. I love the conversation with Rand and Egwene. I know Egwene doesn’t, but it’s good for them to talk. I also loved Rand explaining his Traveling with the bending of the Pattern… but right, what does he Bore into?? Hmmmm. And Egwene sees Rand talking to LTT but she doesn’t know who and she thinks he is going mad. Hmmmmm. Onto the next perspective.</p>

        <p>Nesune (BROWN AJAH), and if you couldn't tell she was Brown, read this perspective again. This was fun! I love being in a Brown's head. Interesting that Nesune could sense Egwene.. I imagine that will be important. And they believe it could be Moiraine still alive.. I agree she still alive but they're wrong! It was Egwene. And I guess in the Royal Library, it was probably Egwene and someone else? Maybe.. not sure. Nesune wants to write a paper about Rand. </p>

        <h2>Ch 28, Letters, DAGGER ICON</h2>
        <p>Rand: well. A lot about toh, Sulin in a dress, Gray Man, Taim talking about a new recruit Jahar Narishma, LTT wants to kill Taim, Rand thinking about Sammael's defenses, Aviendha lecturing Rand about toh, gai-shain taking away the Gray Man as Rand is laughing, letters from Sea Folk asking for Rand, Rand making a light with Fire and Air (that's so cool). Now to a FAIN PERSPECTIVE?! OH NO!</p>

        <p>Fain: good gracious.. GROSS FAIN! Okay.... so how and when did Fain bond Rand? How did that happen? Was it because of The Ways? Fain is becoming more Mordeth with these *tricks*.. interesting. So he needs to touch his victims.. so don't let Fain touch you! And Fain has only a few Fades, Trollocs, and Whitecloaks and a few Darkfriends in Caemlyn and coming from Tar Valon. Fain can also sense Darkfriends, that's pretty cool. And gross he goes to rape this poor woman. GROSS!</p>

        <h2>Ch 29, Fire and Spirit, Wheel and Snake</h2>
        <p>HOLY SHOOT! NYNAEVE!! WOOOOOO! Healed Logain with Fire and Spirit.. the hole she found in Logain. HOLY SHOOT! Also, Thom and Juilin are back and the Little Tower want to talk to them. HOLY SHOOT NYNAEVE. Y'all are hating on my Nynaeve, she's great! Also, Nynaeve got drunk and I appreciate her apologizing. Also also, Thom heard Morgase is with the Whitecloaks.. she is! And Elayne thinks she's actually dead. OKAY READING ON! HOLY SHOOT!</p>

        <h2>Ch 30, To Heal Again, Flame of Tar Valon</h2>
        <p>Nynaeve healed Siuan and Leane! WOO! Oh that's so awesome. And Logain, I think I've said this before, but he is SCARY! I have literally no idea what he is capable of or what he would do if he even had an inch of power over these Aes Sedai.. WHOA! I'm also VERY INTERESTED if they can break Nynaeve's block! That would be great! Also, yes, I see what the Aes Sedai mean by her needing to keep scrubbing pots.. lol. Next perspective!</p>

        <p>Confused. Also, I hope to get more info on this Warder bond business, since Siuan is feeling for her Warder Alric now. But why aren't they as strong as they were? Cofused! And Siuan and Leane are going to go talk to the Sitters to see if they're Aes Sedai again, and Siuan thinks she should be reinstated as Amyrlin.. I don't see this going well. Also, are Siuan and Gareth Bryne going to be in love?! OH BOY lol. ALso, a quick perspective switch over to Ealyne without a page break.. hmm.</p>

        <p>Elayne. So Siuan and Leane *will be* Aes Sedai again. Siuan sticking with the Blue Ajah, and Leane going to petition to join the Green... hmm! Do you *have* to be Green if you want more Warders? I feel like there is a lot more to that then just Green (the multiple Warders). Just interesting to me. And interesting that Siuan and Leane aren't as strong as they were.... AND! Interesting about this hierarchy business with how strong the Aes Sedai is in the One Power. Next perspective! </p>

        <p>Delana Mosaline perspective. WE HAVE A FORSAKEN IN SALIDAR... well, a second Forsaken.. where the heck is Moghedien? Would somebody put a leash on her! Okay, so we've got Aran'gar, which my thought was Aginor! OH WOW THIS GOING TO BE BIG! And Siuan wants to join the Wise One TAR meetings. </p>

        <h2>Ch 31, Red Wax, Whitecloak Sunburst Icon</h2>
        <p>Eamon Valda, I'll give this to the Whitecloaks, they have quite possibly the coolest names of any places. The Fortress of the Light.. the Dome of Truth. Whoa! Albeit that they remind me of Nazi's, that is not good at all. Horrible actually. So there's that. And Valda doesn't like Morgase being there. Got it. And so strange, they'd hang someone after they're dead. And there sounds like there might be a bit of a coup amongst the Whitecloaks with Valda against Niall.</p>

        <p>Niall, sneaky sneaky! I love to get a Niall perspective.. I don't love Niall, I just love to get to see through his eyes. And more notes. And Niall has a *feeling* that something is happening. Agreed, Niall. </p>

        <p>Oh Morgase, well we lost Patir (darkfriend) and her escape plan.. okay, onto the next. Now, this Treaty that she signed. HMMMM. It is going to take a LONGTIME for her to undo this, and I really can't even picture how this will all playout. THIS IS CRAZY. Also, love the "do you play stones?" and aw "she had had the best teacher in the Game of Houses" THOM! Okay, onto the next perspective. </p>

        <p>Asunawa didn't know that Patir was connected to Morgase.. interesting. AND Asunawa has an elaborate trial planned for Morgase.. uh oh. And he hopes she continues to resist Nial so he can extract a confession.. for her as a Darkfriend? </p>
