        <p>I am currently reading, as of May 2, 2023, so this is going to be a review in progress! And below, I'm going to have notes as I read, by chapter. More than likely spoilers, so I'm going to keep those hidden by the box below. When I've finished my read, the Notes box will be moved below the spoiler box, probably past the score!</p>

    <!-- <h2>Review Score</h2>
    <p>I'm trying a new way of reviewing, by implementing a new way to review - using a format taken from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@2ToRamble" target="_blank">2toRamble</a>! <em>And that’s the system! Rate those 5 categories out of 10, average your score, and that’s your /10 Rambler Rating! You can rate each category to the nearest hundredth, tenth, whole number, or whatever you please.</em></p>

    <p>There is a particular aspect to spoilers that I prefer to make known to you.</p> 
    <p>If you don't want to see the spoilers, you won't see them. There is a clear break when spoilers begin and they are typically separated by a <strong style="color:red;">RED</strong> box with the words "Spoilers".</p>
    <p>If you'd prefer not to read them, don't! More power to you. But, thank you for reading as you do.</p>

        <h2>Prologue, The First Message</h2>
        <p>Good gracious. Not only do we get a Forsaken perspective - Demandred, we get more of Shayol Ghul, the Pit of Doom, Thakan’dar, HOLY SMOKES. We also get the GREAT LORD OF THE DARK TALKING TO DEMANDRED?! AHHHH! And how Thakan’dar blades are made… by murdering people?! Golly! AND THE BORE?! AND THAT THIS IS TODAY… A DAY AFTER FIRES OF HEAVEN! I AM FREAKING OUT!! This is amazing!! And Nae’blis… one step below the Great Lord huh? Interesting.</p>

        <p>Oh, and a Nynaeve perspective.. yay! Okay, a lot here. Nynaeve is working hard at figuring out how to Heal stilling and gentling, and she is justifiably weary of Healing Logain’s Gentling. Mogi was actually Marigan from the boat! Fascinating! Stilling is something that has been cut or torn (Severed as Mogi called it). And the weather huh? The Dark One’s doing.</p>

        <p>Next is an Elayne perspective. And boy, I like Elayne too... oh and Min! Hey, I knew Elayne was going to do something with the ter'angrael.. and she did! She was able to copy it from the a'dam! That's crazy awesome! I also love that they are learning things from Mogi (another teacher from the AOL!!). I appreciate Mogi being complicate, well as much as she can be since she's collared.. haha! But I look forward to seeing Min meet up with Rand. And what the heck is the Dark One doing with the weather!</p>

        <p>I don't know if I've said it yet... but I love Perrin, and I love Faile. I also love Loial. I'm happy about this crew. Oh this was a great perspective.. Faile! She's great! I appreciate that she is taking to this Lady business as Perrin doesn't want to be around. I love the fact that a lot of people are coming to the Two Rivers and Emond's Field. That's great! Oh and Perrin needs to go to Rand... YES! I can't wait. Are we going to get Min getting to Rand and Perrin getting to Rand this book?! I CAN'T WAIT! Interesting Verrin and Alanna are gone.. I guess they are going to Salidar? And wait.. is Alanna the Green that is bonded to Lan now?? I can't seem to remember. This is going to be a huge book.</p>

        <p>GAWYN NO! Dang it.. this peddler has started something that I am not looking forward to. I hate that Gawyn now wants to kill Rand when he's on his way with six Aes Sedai to capture Rand. This is not going to be good. I can smell it. Not good. My prediction is Rand won't be able to kill Gawyn but Gawyn will try to kill Rand, but the Maidens will kill Gawyn, and try explaining that to Elayne, Rand! OH THIS IS GOING TO STINK! Also, for note taking.. Corien is the "leader" of the Aes Sedai, and Elaida told him nothing. Gotta be a Black Ajah plot right?? Oh no! But, there were only six Aes Sedai.. we might be okay.. might be. And these sneaky Shaido Wise One's hmm..</p>

        <p>Katerine Alruddin, good gracious.. BLACK AJAH PLOT! There are so many people that want to kill Rand right now. OH NO. Okay, I have to put this in more for me than anything.. okay Aes Sedai agelessness again. "Galina Casban looked forty at most, but that was twice Katerine's true age". No thoughts, just adding it to my notes. This is getting deep knowing now that this group's mission was not Elaida's and this was completely Black Ajah plot! WHOA!</p>

        <p>Sevanna (COULADIN'S WIDOW).. this strange wetlander hmm. Forsaken, gotta be, or Fain. What's this box?? This Prologue is DEEP.</p>

        <p>MORGASE... PAITR IS A DARKFRIEND! I'm glad we're getting a Morgase perspective, and now she knows Gaebril/Rahvin is dead. Will she be going to Ghealdan like Tallanvor wants? Who knows.</p>

        <p>Pedron Niall, a sneaky Sonofagun.. And we get Carridin.. sorry, Bors! Not looking good. Now this Guaire Amalasan, interesting Worldbuilding. Niall doesn't want any Children to go to Salidar. Okay, onto the next!</p>

        <p>Masaana the Forsaken! YES! I love it when we get Forsaken in cahoots! I find it.. interesting, that when Masaana went to the Pit of Doom the ceiling was shorter - so that it brushed her hair. Maybe this is insignificant, but maybe it's not. And interesting that the DO didn't say anything to her. AND interesting that these Forsaken are looking for angreal and sa'angreal AND interesting about this Statis Box.. what the heck is that?! AND THAT HAS THE BE THE BOX THAT SEVANNA HAS, AND THAT HAS TO HAVE BEEN A FORSAKEN THAT GAVE THE BOX TO SEVANNA! Also, who is the Lord of Chaos?!</p>

        <p>Osan'gar / Aran'gar.. pardon me.. what? Is this one person or two?! This raises so many questions.. why can't men touch Saidar? why can't women touch Saidin? Could this amalgamation of a human touch both halves? what the heck is this thing?? And we get Shaidar Haran again... interesting.</p>

        <h2>Ch 1, Lion on the Hill</h2>
        <p>A wind rises in Cairhien. Alright, this is good. Rand is hearing more and more of LTT in his head.. I WANT MORE OF THAT!! Alright, Egwene is in Cairhien. Rand is still in Caemlyn. Rand has a plan to take Illian, plan from Mat + Bashere, but of course more Mat than Bashere! This is so good. ALso, Bashere's nine thousand horses includes nobles and officers AND THEIR WIVES... I definitely think Faile will want to go with Perrin everywhere - because this is Saldaen culture. And lastly.. we get Mazrim Taim entering the Palace.. WHOA!</p>

        <h2>Ch 2, A New Arrival</h2>
        <p>Mazrim Taim.. man I feel exactly as Rand does here. I'm worried not to trust Taim. And it is quite possibly because Rand isn't the only male channeler. But Rand needs help, or at least he will for the Last Battle. I just don't know. Getting some funny feelings from Taim. I appreciate there is a name for Rand's Seanchan spear.. The Dragon Scepter. And where is Rand going to take Taim?? lol</p>

        <p>Also, anyone going to mention Asmodean?</p>

        <h2>Ch 3, A Woman's Eyes</h2>
        <p>I love this. 27 possible male channellers in the few weeks since Rand has called for them. That's good. Feels like a very insignificant number. I hope more come and I expect more to come as well. Not sure how, but I'm sure there might! Rand is pretty strong. I so badly want to trust Taim. And YES! We get Rand thinking that Asmo fled - glad it's been acknowledged. And LTT, whatcha doin' in there? And Taim can hold as much as Rand can.. well well well. Interesting. I want Rand to be the most powerful and I have heard he is.. I'm just really jealous that someone might be close to Rand in power. AHH TAIM! Also, I love Rand opening gateways!</p>

        <h2>Ch 4, A Sense of Humor</h2>
        <p>I am so interested in Aiel humor lol. I don't get it at all, and I hope I do one day. Alright so we've got Hearne, Simaan, Darlin, Tedosian, and Estanda rebelling against Rand and have gone to Haddon Mirk. I appreciate that Rand is choosing to ignore that for now.. that's for future Rand. Rand has a lot on his plate! Also, Rand being called Lord of the Morning.. nice! And Rand hasn't heard LTT since he told him to "shut up". I find that....... interesting. I will keep an eye out for that. Also, Rand has been using TAR!</p>

        <h2>Ch 5, A Different Dance</h2>
        <p>SHEESH. I. LOVE. MAT. This is so great. Alright, a lot here in 30+ pages. Mat and the BAND OF THE RED HAND, that is freaking awesome. I love Mat. I am so interested in Mat's memories and Mat's Luck. so much of that is barely explained, and I'm so read to learn more. I really think it's awesome that Mat is Mat. He is like no other main character here. I am interested in what the Horn means to / for Mat now, just a lot has happened and he doesn't have it, and he died. So is it still linked to it? I love Mat and Betse, that's sweet. I'm interested to know why Mat has memories when dancing... interesting. Also, anytime any character cares for someone less fortunate puts me in my feels, Mat and Olver is great. It makes me very happy. AND Mat and the Red Hand moving to Tear.. interesting, is there just going to be an absolutely massive army to attack Sammael in Illian? That'd be neat.</p>

        <h2>Ch 6, Threads Woven of Shadow</h2>
        <p>Before I read... this is my new favorite chapter symbol and chapter title. Without a doubt, I'm here for it! WOO! Sammael, are you my favorite Forsaken? Interesting. This was an awesome perspective. I love seeing the Forsaken interact and I'm so interested in all these Old-Tongue words: jegal, choss-hauler, conje. Also, is Graendal talking about Shara?! That's pretty neat. I'm going to write these words down to remember.. Sh'boan, Sh'botay. I find it interesting that Sammael won't call Rand LTT.. why? Here we go! And the ILLUSION! That's the holding of the image when Graendal was using to make herself look different. Very interesting.</p>

        <p>Graendal.. golly. She’s cunning and smart. Lady Basene. Okay, I have no idea who that is. I’m sure we’ll find out! Very interesting - this whole thing. And what has Mesaana bound? Semirhage?</p>

        <p>And Semirhage.. she scares me. She seems so smart and so ready to be able to do SOME HARM. And yes, I believe the other Forsaken also very bad, but these Forsaken that we've recently heard from are just very scary. And let's talk a bit here. Shaidar Haran, I'm with Semirhage - what is he?? WHY IS HE SO DIFFERENT. Also, interesting that the Forsaken don't understand the Warder bond. And Semi has killed the Warder. And this Aes Sedai is Cabriana Mecandes. Okay. I will continue to say Lanfear and Moiraine are not dead.</p>
