        <h2>When I Started Reading</h2>
        <p>I'm really happy to be back reading the Wheel of Time. Make sure to check out my <a href="../../html/reviews/franchise/wheel-of-time-in-review.html">Wheel of Time in Review</a>!</p>

        <p>I am currently reading, as of June 19, 2023, so this is going to be a review in progress! And below, I'm going to have notes as I read, by chapter. More than likely spoilers, so I'm going to keep those hidden by the box below. When I've finished my read, the Notes box will be moved below the spoiler box, probably past the score!</p>

        <h2>Written Review</h2>
        <p>Book Seven had a lot of expectations to reach, after the ending of Book Six - Lord of Chaos. I felt this fell a little flat for me. I read this in two weeks, and that was good. I didn't feel this was a SLOG, but I my socks weren't blown off. A good Wheel of Time book for sure!</p>

        <p>The more I think about this book.. I really liked it, but it hasn't been my favorite Wheel of Time book. Still a 4 out of 5 for me. Not a 5 out of 5 like the others! Hopefully A Path of Daggers gets a higher score.</p>

            <p>This book is a bit violent and dark. I’m so excited to continue this series! 9 more books to go!</p> 
                
            <p>This is my favorite book in the series so far. There is a lot of story left, many story threads left open and there is a building of a villain coming back and so much more.</p>
                
            <p>This, I believe is the longest book in the series, at 1,015 pages. It took me over a month to read, a lot of family things happening in that time, so it didn’t feel very long.</p>

    <p>If you don't want to see the spoilers, you won't see them. There is a clear break when spoilers begin and they are typically separated by a <strong style="color:red;">RED</strong> box with the words "Spoilers".</p>

        <h2>Spoilers</h2>
        <p>Just a bit of preamble here.. the way this review will be is a lot of different from others. I'm wrote notes on every single chapter that I read. Which is completely spoiler, so this is where the spoilers start.. read at your own risk!</p>
    
        <p>And now I'm adding in predictions for upcoming books and more! Check that out below.</p>

<!-- spoilers -->
    <!-- <details id="spoilers">
        <summary>Spoilers</summary>

        <h2>Spoiler Review</h2>
        <p>This book, I wanted to love. I didn’t love it as much I did Lord of Chaos. This book didn’t really do much in terms of plot, it really setup for the next books I’m guessing. But I felt this book fell flat. I was expecting a lot, that was probably my fault. </p>

        <h2>Timeline</h2>
        <p>This book also only took place over 10 days, which really makes you put into perspective that not much happened this book. That might be while I’m so hung up. I wanted so much more from this and I feel like only a few things happened. </p>

        <h2>Rand</h2>
        <p>I’m really interested to see what happens next! The start, Rand comes back after Dumai’s Wells and he is in a bad place after all those deaths because of him, he didn’t kill them himself, but he helped form the Asha’man and a bunch of people came to his rescue to kill A LOT OF SHAIDO. That’s a lot for Rand, and this book we see a bit of the aftermath of that in Rand’s mood. Rand also has sex with Min, that was an odd scene because Rand and Min just learned of Herid Fell’s death and emotions were running in strange directions. But they did. An old Aes Sedai, Cadsuane, comes in and Rand is having trouble with her.</p>

        <h2>Perrin</h2>
        <p>We got Rand banishing Perrin with a bunch of people including Faile and Berelain, and some Two Rivers men - to get Masema and bring him to Rand. Masema is a lot crazy, so I can’t even imagine what is going to happen next with that. Before that, Perrin spent a lot of time trying to make up with Faile. They did… wink. </p>

        <h2>Mat</h2>
        <p>Mat was very ta’veren this book. Also, there was some horrible things that happened to Mat. He was sexually assaulted by a Queen. He thought she would stop, but she didn’t. Now Mat has to live with that forever. </p>

        <h2>Nynaeve</h2>
        <p>I still love Nynaeve. This book, she acted a like a very stubborn human would, in how she treated Mat. </p>

        <h2>Aviendha</h2>
        <p>Oh, Aviendha didn’t do much this book. She was just kind of here. She tasted sea water and didn’t like it. Anything else?</p>

        <h2>Dragonmount Summary</h2>

        <summary style="background-color: rgb(27, 105, 57);">Predictions and Theories</summary>
        <h2 style="font-style:italic;">Predictions</h2>
        <p>Let's see how I do, when I check back here after a few books.</p>

        <h2>From Lord of Choas</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Who is the lord of chaos, We still don't know.</li>
            <li>Where is Logain, We didn't see Logain at all this book.</li>
            <li>The cloud bowl, will it work? We got the bowl in the second to last chapter, haven't used it yet.</li>
            <li>Moiraine, Still dead, might be a part of some prophecies.</li>
            <li>Lan, Made it to Myrelle,then Egwene opened a Gateway for Lan to get to Ebou Dar.. then he got to Ebou Dar and saved Nynaeve from drowning and then Nynaeve was able to break her block by surrendering. Then Lan and Nynaeve got married!</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>What's Next?</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mat's Dice, Okay, so Mat ending this book with a building falling on top of him as the Seanchan invaded Ebou Dar. I have no idea what the Dice are really for, and I want to know what is going on. Also, I don't believe Mat dead.. can't be!</li>
            <li>Alanna's Bond, We keep getting little bits of this, but I'm really interested in this. I want to know if Rand will be able to break this or not.</li>
            <li>Moiraine is Not Dead, From the Fires of Heaven, I still think Moiraine is not dead. Neither is Lanfear. We don't know much about where they are - in that doorway ter'angreal. No way they're dead! I'm excited to learn more about them.</li>
            <li>LTT in Rand's Head, The end of this book didn't have much about this, I'm still interested!</li>
            <li>The Watcher, Moirdin, I THINK THIS IS ISHAMAEL! We haven't gotten any confirmation, but I THINK IT'S ISHAMAEL. I'm so excited about this prediction. Because.. (this is from chapter 20) The Watcher. Okay, I'm going to rant a bit here. THIS IS ISHAMAEL! YES YES YES! Oh, i'm so excited about this prediction. This is Ishamael. He's back! Using the **True Power** holy cow!! WOW. Okay, first off, I was wrong, the two Caddar and Maisia was Sammael and Graendal. ANyway, this is Ishamael, for sure. I am excited to learn more about this True Power, the one that Lanfear and.. someone I can't remember was trying to get/use in the Rhuidean visions. Wow. Okay, so this True Power comes straight from the Great Lord and the Watcher... Ishamael, sees black flecks in his vision. Gosh I'm just so excited about this prediction. Mesaan ahad a hand in kidnapping Rand. Graendal won't risk teaching the Wise Ones Compulsion unless Sammael has found a binder.. nice! The Watcher, Ishamael, is covered in fancloth except for his eyes so he can't be seen. Graendal hates the name Maisia. Sammael opens a Gateway, and eventually Graendal follows. The Watcher feels the prickling of saidar end and smiles crookedly. He decides not to kill the eight women. AND RIPS A HOLE IN THE PATTERN WITH THE TRUE POWER AND STEPS OUTSIDE THE PATTERN. HO-LY CRAP! Ishamael. Ishamael. Also more and more predictions. Ishamael will be Nae'blis. Ishamael is the Lord of Chaos. Ishamael. YES YES YES!<br><br>Why do I think that? Honestly, I think this only because we've gotten Osan'gar and Aran'gar come back, so now we know that Forsaken can come back. But this True Power thing has me feeling Ishamael. It was a feeling I got with how knowledgable the Water seemed with the world and Sammi and Graendi. And how excited he was to use the True Power. And his skin prickled when Graendi channeled. And this person is clearly from AOL and at least super knowledgeable with saidin and the Pattern to be able to step outside. And I am just begging for Ishi to come back.. lol</li>
            <li>Egwene and Aes Sedai Fealty, Egwene has several Aes Sedai swear featly directly to Egwene and that hasn't happened EVER BEFORE. I'm excited to find out what are the ramifications for this.</li> 
            <li>Cadsuane, She is probably not a Darkfriend, but she is fiesty. She isn't going to be good for Rand or Asha'man.</li>
            <li>Seanchan, THEY'RE BACK! Oh this is going to be crazy, I'm so excited about this.</li>

    <h2>My Thoughts</h2>
    <p>Oh no, I struggled a bit with this book. Something that is holding this book up.. the prose and world building! Other than that.. not the best I've read so far. I tell you what, I am struggling with numbers. Does anyone care about numbers? Do you care if I like the book? Most of my reviews are 5/5 anyway, I love almost everything that I read or watch, so let’s talk categories.</p>

    <h2>Emotional Impact</h2>
    <p>This book was an easy read, but I just wasn't as impacted emotionally to this book. It was good, some good things happened, but it is hard to come close to Rand in the box or Dumai's Wells. </p>

    <h2>Characters</h2>
    <p>Nothing really stands out to me about any characters in particular. But, I will say - I'm pretty interested in a few characters. Cadsuane, an old Green Ajah Aes Sedai who won't stand down. The Watcher.. who I think is Ishamael back! The Asha'man, I'm so interested in learning more about them. Rand went through a lot this book, not as much as the last book, but he has a lot on his plate. I love Lan, I'm interested in his story with Nynaeve now. My love for Nynaeve went down a bit this book, but I'm still interested in her story. Mat, always a winner for me, was raped this book. And that was hard to read. He kept trying to brush it off, but he is hurting.</p> 

    <h2>Plot</h2>
    <p>Hmm. Seanchan have started to invade, we got that near the end. We've got the Bowl of the Winds. Nynaeve and Lan are married and Nynaeve has broken her block! Rand and Min made love. Fain sliced Rand with the Ruby Dagger. Rand now is the King of Illian. I really don't know if Rand killed Sammael. There is a new power.. the True Power from the Dark One. Mat was raped. Elaida is looking for Black Ajah in the Tower. More people learned how to Travel. We have a Knitting Circle, an incredible number of rogue Aes Sedai Wise Women, over 1700! And Aes Sedai are really old! We meet one who is over 400 years old! Also, Loial is going to all the steddings and the Waygates.</p>

    <h2>Prose</h2>
    <p>Always a pleasure to read RJ's writing. Perfect. </p>

    <h2>World Building</h2>
    <p>BIG BIG BIG building here! TRUE POWER! A new power that is used by the Chosen who were chosen by the Dark One! Oh and a gholam is here! Seanchan are invading! HERE WE GO!</p>
