<h2>Written Review</h2>
<p><strong>** spoiler alert **</strong></p>

<h2>My Apologies</h2>
<p>Don't read this review unless you've seen the movie, because apparently I wanted to spoil the entire movie...</p>

<p>Before I start, please enjoy the final trailer for Halloween Ends!</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s0vtbxLa-N8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<blockquote>The Final Trailer for Halloween Ends</blockquote>

<h2>40+ Years to this Finale</h2>
<p>You could say this is one way to end a 40+ year old series.</p>

<p>The first Halloween Movie in this Halloween series originally released in 1978, try and watch this trailer..</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T5ke9IPTIJQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<blockquote>Halloween 1978 Trailer</blockquote>

<h2>Score</h2>
<p>I'd give this a 4/5, because this movie was unexpected! Super gorey, and super Corey.. sorry for that pun. Truly an awesome movie. Not the best movie of this trilogy but a great movie!</p>


<h2>Corey Cunningham aka Michael Myers Jr</h2>
<p>Alright, let's talk about Corey.</p>

<img src="../../img/reviews/hall-ends/corey-laurie.jfif" alt="corey-laurie">
<blockquote>Corey and Laurie</blockquote>

<p>This Corey character was written in for this movie, it seemed. I haven't done much research, but after watching the trailers I did not expect what was going to happen once it happened in the movie. This movie is <strong>GOREY</strong>!</p>

<p>From the very start of the movie this movie was bloody and gruesome, and really told a story of what can happen to someone who gets bullied, with some extenuating circumstances <em>ergo Michael Myers</em>.</p>

<p>Michael had such an effect on Corey, I couldn't imagine what happened was going to happen. Really Corey might've been worse than Michael in this movie at least.</p>

<img src="../../img/reviews/hall-ends/corey-girl.webp" alt="corey-allyson">
<blockquote>Corey and Allyson</blockquote>

<p>And I have absolutely no idea how this happened either?! Corey and Allyson?! I can't believe Allyson could be so blind to this broken character. Corey murdered people and came back to Allyson and she didn't even think to question Corey. She just wanted to be with Corey, and maybe it's because she is broken as well. That is something that I'm not too intelligent to communicate a good review of; other than I was questioning their relationship for most of the entire movie. Not that I didn't find their relationship plausible, it just seemed like something was going to drop to break their relationship apart, and that just so happened to be Corey somehow taking some of Michael Myers essence and going on a murder spree.</p>

<h2>Corey as Michael</h2>
<img src="../../img/reviews/hall-ends/corey-mom.png" alt="corey-mom">
<blockquote>Corey wearing Michael's Mask, Killing his Mother</blockquote>

<p>Corey just wanted to be Michael's apprentice or something and he just went off and started killing like 7 people! I look forward to watching the Dead Meat KillCount for this movie; this is a youtube channel you should really check out! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/DeadMeat" target="_blank">DeadMeat on YouTube</a>.</p>

<p>Corey killed so many people then he went to kill Laurie, because Laurie felt the same thing she felt with Michael, <em>that they were pure evil</em>, and Laurie wanted to keep Corey away from Laurie. Corey had other plans.</p>

<p>Corey thought, "if I can't have Allyson, no one can". What he meant by that was, Laurie couldn't even have Allyson. Because in that moment Corey stabbed himself in the throat, and made it seem like Laurie wanted to kill Corey. Because, just after that Allyson walked through the door to see Laurie on top of Corey holding the knife in Corey's throat... <strong>wow, powerful stuff</strong>.</p>

<h2>Here's Michael</h2>
<p>At this point, Corey had stolen Michael's mask, but Michael was in the house. Michael took his mask back and tried to come for Laurie.</p>

<p>From here on, anything could've happened.</p>

<img src="../../img/reviews/hall-ends/michael-laurie.webp" alt="michael-laurie">
<blockquote>Another Michael Laurie Fight</blockquote>

<p>Michael and Laurie fight, and they just feel like they are so <strong>old</strong>, and they are. <em>In movie world</em>, they've been going at each other for over 40 years. So by this point they're at least 60+ years old. This fight really shows just how old and slow they are. They both get thrown across the room, but it takes a lot for them to stand up.. and then..</p>

<img src="../../img/reviews/hall-ends/laurie-stabbed.webp" alt="laurie-stabbed">
<blockquote>Laurie stabbed just like she stabbed Michael</blockquote>

<p>Laurie finally pins Michael down with multiple knives through his body, and she slits his throat. But Michael rips his hand off one knife and starts chocking Laurie. We get some incredible flashbacks through their years. All their stabs and fights, and deaths.</p>

<p>Allyson comes to save the day, and Laurie slits Michael's wrist after dropping a fridge on his legs to pin him down.</p>

<h2>Michael Myers is Finally Dead</h2>
<p>Not yet, the town of Haddonfield has to parade his body around the town; which they do strapped on top of Allyson's car. Until finally Laurie gets to push Michael's body into a compactor. Michael's body is literally squished and broken into tiny pieces and is dead.</p>

<p>That's the movie</p>



<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>I don't know if I've seen any more gruesome death scenes than this movie. But maybe if I rewatch the previous Halloween Movies I might have a few top these, but wow. This movie was gnarly.</p>

<p>A must watch.</p>
