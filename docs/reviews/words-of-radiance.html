<h2>Written Review</h2>
<p>** spoiler alert **</p> 
<p>I don’t really know how to write a review. Let’s just put that out at the start here.</p>

<p>The goal is to review this book and tell you what I think about it. This book is hard to describe. This book is a story about an incredible cast of characters with an amazing world and amazing magic system and overall just an amazing time.</p>

<p>If you’ve never read Brandon Sanderson, I highly recommend it. if you’ve never read epic fantasy I highly recommend it.</p>

<p>It is hard to describe this book without spoiling this book, because this is booked two in the storm light archive series, and the Stormlight Archive series is going to be a 10 book series. You are the right, I’m in book 2.</p>

<p>This book is 1088 pages long. This is 70 or so pages longer than the first book and my book for the books are around 1200 pages long.  oh, it’s so great. It’s so much fun.</p>

<p>OK now let’s talk about the book..</p>

<br><br>

<p>At the time of writing this review, I am on page 800 so I have about 200 more pages to go and wow oh wow. I’m going to try not to spoil this book but this book if you’ve read the first book, you’ll know this book is going through the story of Kaladin, Shallan, Dalinar, and so many more characters. I will say the back of the book really tells a great synopsis of the book. It talks about the light weavers, and the surge binders, and the wind runners. Incredible.</p>

<p>The way, Brandon tells the stories make you cry make you shout for joy make you want to read more.</p>

<p>After spending so much time with these characters you really understand them more, and feel for them when things go poorly for them. Every turn of this book, you may expect, but Brandon has a way of turning every turn on its head. You’ll never be able to know exactly what is going to happen. You may get small drips of, “oh yeah I remember that character, but oh wow I didn’t expect that!” Also, Hoid is amazing and I love every second of page time he gets. He is a joy to read.</p>

<p>Kaladin’s powers are increasing, we got more Szeth which is always a win, Syl is revealing more, T’aln?! AMARAM, Sadeas?! What is going to happen next?</p>

<p>Again, I’m only 800 pages in. I’ll update when I have more.</p>

<p>No, I don’t want to spoil this book so I had a recommend this book 5 out of 5. I can’t wait to read more. I can’t wait to read more of the store my arch time there is no way anything can top the Stormlight Archive.</p>
