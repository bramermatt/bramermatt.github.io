<h2>Written Review</h2>
<p>** spoiler alert **</p> 
<p>Warbreaker; A story of politics, dead things coming back to life, a magic system built on keeping or bringing things back to life, colors to the most impeccable distinction, a great story of a sister coming to save her sister from what she thinks is pure evil, and also a little bit of a sexual component.</p>

<p>This story is great, these characters are great, this world is great, Brandon Sanderson is great. I’m continually impressed as I read these Brandon Sanderson books at the complexity of these magic systems and worlds. He truly does some amazing work, realizing what could and should happens on these planets, and how everything connects.</p>

<p>Also, I really appreciate this book and how it was released. It was released on Brandon’s website first, then eventually completed and published. But you can read the entire book for free on his site. Also, there are annotations for this book on the site as well, so you get Brandon’s thoughts right as you read the book too.</p>

<h2>Read Warbreaker and Annotations</h2>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.brandonsanderson.com/warbreaker-introduction/" target="_blank">Read the Book</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.brandonsanderson.com/category/annotations/warbreaker-annotations/" target="_blank">Read the Annotations</a></li>
</ul>


<h2>Forms</h2>
<p>I chose to read this book in a few forms, as I typically do with Brandon books. They’re some long books, and I like to read on my lunch breaks at work, where other coworkers are conversing. So I find it fun to listen to the audiobook while I read the book in front of me. Really gives me that tactile feel of the book, which the incredible voice acting behind the audiobooks. For Warbreaker, being that the book was on Brandon’s site, I chose to use the Kindle copy of the book! This was my first real experience with a kindle and it was a great one! I’m using the Kindle 10th generation; <a href="https://www.amazon.com/kindle-2019-10th-generation/s?k=kindle+2019+10th+generation" target="_blank">buy that Kindle here</a>!</p>

<p>But reading on the kindle has been an enjoyable experience. I won’t say it’s a perfect experience, but it’s enjoyable. I don’t really want to read things on my phone, if I’m reading a book. But the kindle is nice because it is really pretty distraction-free reading and it’s a good size and weight.</p>

<h2>The Spoils</h2>
<p>I thought this book was incredible. I was shocked when certain characters died, like Lightsong. I was shocked when certain characters didn't die, like Vasher. I was open mouth shocked when Blushweaver was killed. I had no idea that was even possible. I'm so excited to learn more about this world, there might be a sequel, but that is not planned or set to release anytime soon.</p>

<p>I honestly found this book to be just the right amount of sexual. Strange phrasing I know, but there were moments when this story had to talk about sex. The crux of the story was - the Idrian's were to give the GodKing an heir. Interestingly the GodKing didn't know <em>how</em> to do that. Eventually coitus is completed. It's never vulgar or <em>on-screen</em>. But sex is important in this book, and I didn't expect that.</p>

<h2>Vasher</h2>
<p>Vasher is awesome. <em>I apologize to spoil some of the Stormlight Archive but</em>, Vasher is Zahel.. I know right?! It's so clear after reading this novel. Want to be more spoiled, here is the <a href="https://coppermind.net/wiki/Vasher" target="_blank">Coppermind Wiki for Vasher</a>.</p>

<p>Vasher is great in this book. There are so many twists in this book, I wasn't sure if Vasher was a good guy or bad. In fact, I still don't know. Maybe he is just Chaotic Good, like Hoid? But Hoid also isn't always <em>good</em>, so I don't really know.</p>

<h2>Nightblood</h2>
<p>I love comedy, and I love comedic relief. I didn't realize that could come from a talking sword that wants to <strong>destroy evil</strong>. When I say talking sword, I don't mean audibly, just in thoughts of those Nightblood thinks should hear. </p>

<p><em>Spoilers for Words of Radiance</em>, NIGHTBLOOD! Szeth has Nightblood. That means Nightblood is close to Vasher, on Roshar.</p>

<h2>Vivenna</h2>
<p>Vivenna is awesome. I really enjoy this aspect of the Royal Locks, that was an interesting part of the magic system. I'm also very proud of Vivenna for staying alive. She is very powerful.</p>

<h2>Lightsong</h2>
<p>Lightsong is awesome. Lightsong might be my favorite part of this novel. Another comedic relief, but also he cares about the people he loves. He fanes comedy but really feels a lot. He worries a lot about if he is really who people say he is, a god.</p>

<p>Besides the god thing, I align very closely to how Lightsong feels. So I really like Lightsong.</p>

<h2>Score</h2>
<p>Warbreaker by Brandon Sanderson 5/5.</p>


<h2>What's Next?</h2>
<p>If you've read <a href="../../docs/blogs/books/reading-next.html">What am I Reading Next?</a>, then you'd know that Edgedancer by Brandon Sanderson is next! I'm really on a Brandon Sanderson kick right now, and I'm going to try and read a lot of Brandon Sanderson back to back for the forseeable future.</p>

<p>I highly recommend this book, and I imagine I will review all Brandon's book like that... we shall see.</p>
