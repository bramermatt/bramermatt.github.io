        <p>I'm really happy to be back reading the Wheel of Time. Make sure to check out my <a href="../../html/reviews/franchise/wheel-of-time-in-review.html">Wheel of Time in Review</a>!</p>

        <p>I am currently reading, as of June 5, 2023, so this is going to be a review in progress! And below, I'm going to have notes as I read, by chapter. More than likely spoilers, so I'm going to keep those hidden by the box below. When I've finished my read, the Notes box will be moved below the spoiler box, probably past the score!</p>

            <p>And here we are. Six books in and we keep building! Robert Jordan has outdone himself, these characters are so incredibly deep. The world is vast and the named characters are getting extravagant.</p>

            <p>This book is a bit violent and dark. I’m so excited to continue this series! 9 more books to go!</p> 
                
            <p>This is my favorite book in the series so far. There is a lot of story left, many story threads left open and there is a building of a villain coming back and so much more.</p>
                
            <p>This, I believe is the longest book in the series, at 1,015 pages. It took me over a month to read, a lot of family things happening in that time, so it didn’t feel very long.</p>
                
            <p>You’re going to love it!</p>

        <p>And now I'm adding in predictions for upcoming books and more! Check that out below.</p>

        <summary style="background-color:rgb(27, 86, 105);">Notes As I Read</summary>
   
        <h2>Prologue, Lightnings, Wheel and Snake</h2>
        <p><strong>Elaida.</strong> Okay, let's talk her own Palace as Amyrlin.. weird right? She asked the neareset stedding: Stedding Jentoine in the Black Hills for help and they declined. Her clock was commissioned by Cemaile Sorenthaine, raised from the Gray Ajah three hundred years ago. Now, a lot of news in the world, but what I really care about it the note from Galina that say's Rand has been haptured.. hmm, sorry Elaida he broke free! I look forward to seeing that realization. Next, notes of Elayne, Nynaeve and *two others* in Ebou Dar (Aviendha and Birgitte). Elaida tells Alviarin to send order to Teslyn and Joline to capture the girls with forkroot again. A Green Ajah agent in Caemlyn reports four hundred men in the Black Tower.. WOO! SO MANY ASHA'MAN! Interesting the Red Ajah have only found twenty-four in the last twenty years, maybe because they can't test them? I'm not sure. Elaida learned about Egwene, and she wants to increase the White Tower Guard because of the supposed twenty thousand men Gareth Bryne is bringin to the White Tower. I look forward to seeing this.. if it happens!</p>

        <p>Elaida has a Fortelling.. "The White Tower will be whole again, except for remnants cast out and scorned, whole and stronger than ever. Rand al'Thor will face the Amyrlin and know her anger. The Black Tower will be rent in blood and fire, and sisters will walk its grounds. This I Foretell." So, this will come true, because it's a Fortelling.. right? But that doesn't mean all will happen like Elaida expects. Like the White Tower whole again: yeah, Egwene as Amylin (my guess). Rand will face Amyrlin and know her anger: Egwene. Black Tower rent with blood and sisters walk its ground: Sisters killed by the Black Tower (that's what I hope, but this could go the way it says). Which, I don't want the Black Tower gone, but we'll see.</p>

        <p><strong>Sevanna.</strong> Hey, cool, Dumai's Wells from Sevanna's perspective. Is there more to say then Sevanna still has this box that is supposed to help her take Rand? This was great to see another perspective!</p>

        <p><strong>Alviarin.</strong> Hey hey, this is cool! So, I'm *really* interested in this now! Masaana in the White tower, hiding her ability to channel... inverted weaves (right?)! So, Ishamael made Alviarin the head of the Black Ajah?! WHOA! Lanfear and Graendal have visited the White Tower, and Be'lal yanked Alviarin out of her sleep to *some strange place*... oh oh! Apparently Elaida's orders were to kidnap the King of Illian and the Queen of Saldea, and offer kingship of Tear to High Lord Darlin.. but does she even have the power to do that? I like Mesaana's "you children almost match the ajah at times"... could that be the Ajahs from the AOL? A Great Council of Thirteen heas the Black Ajah... spooky! I LOVE IT! Mesaana doesn't care about the Black Tower. Mesaana also warns Alviarin to only serve her, not Semirhage, Demandred, or Graendal. MESAANA TEACHES ALVIARIN HOW TO TRAVEL! I'm so excited about this. BLACK AJAH PLOT! BLACK AJAH PLOT!</p>

        <p><strong>Pedron Niall.</strong> WHOA! Niall has been stabbed by Omerna?! WHOA! Then Eamon Valda killed Omerna for treason! Faisar's message to Niall was confirming the Seanchan invasion in Tarabon. Also, Morgase really wants to see Galad. IS NIALL GOING TO DIE? Reading on!</p>

        <p><strong>Eamon Valda.</strong> Pedron Niall is dead. Wow. You know, for the horrible crew the Whitecloaks are, I liked the sneaky Pedron Niall. But here we go. Eamon Valda will be Lord Captain Commander. Valda really wants Morgase, to kill her since she's a *witch*. And Valda doesn't like Balwer. Wow.</p>

        <p><strong>Gawyn.</strong> We're back at Dumai's Wells. Gawyn wishes he killed Rand, he keeps thinking that. Gawyn also sees an Aes Sedai fall, and we don't know who this is. I can't think of who this might be.. could be Galina if she knows how to Travel?? Since she is gone when Gawyn gets there? Maybe. Then some more Aiel come to fight with Gawyn's 200 Younglings Gawyn killed 4 Aiel and that's cool, go Gawyn. The Younglings start to make camp, and plan to head back to Tar Valon.</p>

        <p>Okay, that's the Prologue.. very good! Here we go to A Crown of Swords!</p>

        <h2>Ch 1, High Chasaline, Wolf</h2>
        <p><strong>Perrin.</strong> Wind blows from Braem Wood past relics of Coremanda, then past the Tar Valon Road. Perrin is there a day after the battle at Dumai's Wells, and at the main camp a mile south of Dumai's Wells. Perrin is worried about Faile in Cairhien. There are two hundred naked Shaido prisoners from DW (can we use this acronym or is there a better one?). Aram seems to be wanting to kill absolutely anyone. Two dozen captive Aes Sedai by Asha'man. Even more Warders under guard. Loial comes up and points out how tense everything is and Perrin heads north on Stepper to join Rand. Okay, maybe I'm hyped off the end of LOC but I'm ready for some action lol.</p>

        <h2>Ch 2, The Butcher's Yard, Ravens</h2>
        <p><strong>Perrin.</strong> Yeesh. Nineteen Two Rivers men, a hundred Mayeners, more Cairhienin, a thousand Aiel: dead at DW. Ouch. Rand knows every name of every Maiden that died. Ouch. Holy smokes, the Rand needing Healing and picks Alanna out... whoa, that was awesome! So cool to see Rand using that bond against Alanna, since she forced it on him. Wow! I really want to talk about Taim, but first, the Wise Ones will watch the Aes Sedai prisoners, nice. To jump to Taim's viewing: Taim has blood in his past and blood in his future, he's a dangerous man. Dashiva (an Asha'man that Rand chose personally to guard Rand) calls Taim M'Hael ("leader" in the Old Tongue), and he explains it as he's been reading a lot on the farm. Hmm. I have a funny feeling about Taim. I can't place it, and I think it's just because I want him to be more submissive to Rand, yes he does submit but after argument and disaggreements. I just want Rand and Taim to connect better. Okay, reading on. </p>

        <h2>Ch 3, Hills of the Golden Dawn, Flame of Tar Valon</h2>
        <p><strong>Perrin.</strong> Oh heck. So, Dashiva is awkward and doesn't know "one end of a sword from the other". Rand trusts Perrin, Min, and Loial. So, since Rand has been gone... 10 days? or more? 16 days? and Colavaere has been crowned in Cairhien. Wow, how?! Berelain just stepped aside? Also, there have been some bubbles of evil killing people. And there are ten Aes Sedai are in the city staying with Arilyn Dhulaine. This scout Wise One Feraighin calls perrin sei'cair. Rand orders the Aes Sedai to be taken to the Aiel tents. Perrin wants to know about Faile and Bain and Chiad aren't with Faile any longer. Loial says he would worry about Erith too. Rand and crew are heading to Cairhien. Oh boy.</p>

        <h2>Ch 4, Into Cairhien, Cairhien Sun</h2>
        <p><strong>Perrin.</strong> My son loves to say "that was happy for me" when he sees a city bus or an airplane or an excavator... and that's how I feel when I read any of RJ's descriptions of places... "that was happy for me"! Okay, this was a fine chapter... lol. Still on Perrin, that's... fine. lol. This Dashiva fella... I can't pinpoint how I feel about him, or Taim for that matter. I also love the magic system in the fact that to Gateway you have *know* the place well enough to Gateway.. that's cool! Perrin learns that Faile is one of Colavaere's attendants.. hmm. </p>

        <h2>Ch 5, A Broken Crow, Dragon</h2>
        <p><strong>Perrin.</strong> So we meet Colavaere. Faile is there too! Rand confronts Colavaere and Rand takes her crown and breaks it then fixes it.. "what is done can be undone" he says. Perrin accuses her of murder (Maringil and Meilan) and asks about Berelain (silly Perrin, not in front of Faile..). Colavaere has Annoura Larisen, a Gray and an advisor to Berelain with her, but Jahar (Asha'man) shields her. Berelain hired thief-catchers who traced the murders to Colavaere. Also let it slip that the Aes Sedai promised her that Rand wouldn't return.... Dobraine comes up and announces Rand's penalty for murder is hanging. Now here is where it gets interesting. Min looks sad at this announcment. Rand then can't bring himself to have her executed, so he has her titles striped and exiles her to her smallest farm. Now, I find that very interesting. How are the Aiel going to take that after what happened to Mangin, he was hanged because of his murder... Hmm. I don't know why Rand is doing this. I really hope it doesn't have to do with Min being sad about this. Hmm. And Rand wants to be taken to Berelain. </p>

        <h2>Ch 6, Old Fear, and New Fear, Wolf</h2>
        <p><strong>Perrin.</strong> How-dy! There you go Perrin, that's what Faile wanted! Pick her up and tell her how it is. Okay, so we get that Faile suggests killing Colavaere and Dobraine refuses. Faile and Perrin nearly got some sexy time, then Rand stomps in lol. That was funny. So, this Perrin.. "*I* won't let you kill the Aes Sedai". WHOA. HMM. Okay, so Berelain is staying on a Sea Folk ship for some reason. Rand seems to be *pausing to listen* to someone.. Rand wants Perrin to command the army against Illian, Perrin says no. Rand wants Perrin to be elsewhere in a day or two. </p>

        <h2>Ch 7, Pitfalls and Tripwires, Caemlyn Lion</h2>
        <p><strong>Rand.</strong> Yes! A Rand perspective. Alright, here we go. So Rand was looking for the fat-man angreal within the wagons! Oh no! He doesn’t have that anymore! Will he go to Rhuidean to get the angreal, or was it ter’angreal in the wall?? Probably not, that’d be too easy. Hey, what’s going on in Rhuidean?? Okay, so Rand wants to know what saidin would be like cleansed?! Oh oh oh!! So, things have been happening while Rand was *away*. Also, I love when Rand tells the Asha’man to “release” saidin and they do and he thinks “good soldiers”. Whoa. I’m scared if they turn on him. Oh boy. Rand really wants Elayne and Aviendha to be in Caemlyn, yet they’re not.. they’re in Ebou Dar! Rand is going to leave Fedwin (strongest Asha’man of the eight here) as a secret messenger. Rand wants to send troops tonight.. to Illian?! Is it starting now?!</p>

        <h2>Ch 8, The Figurehead, Forsnaken</h2>
        <p><strong>Egwene.</strong> Woo, and Egwene perspective! Okay, so reading this chapter, I had to stop reading and wonder... was this a retcon - the fact that Mogi was still attached to the a'dam... and then she had the a'dam necklace removed. Got it. Okay, cople of things here. Bryne's army is thirty thousand. Logain has escaped.. (from Egwene's plan.. right?). Egwene is getting another headache... interesting. Siuan was chosen Amyrlin very young because the previous three each died after just a few years.. interesting. DSheriam notices the bracelet that Egwene wears and tells her it was a gift from Elayne and Nynaeve. Egwene asks Sheriam about the ten sisters that were sent to Tar Valon (two each ajah besides Blue). Ah Forsaken counts! Dead: Asmo, Ravin, Ishamaael, Be'lal. Aginor and Balthamel (... not anymore). Demandred, Sammael, Graendal, Masaana, Semirage, (definitely spelling these wrong on purpose ;)). Neat!</p>

        <h2>Ch 9, A Pair of Silverspike, Flame of Tar Avalon</h2>
        <p><strong>Egwene.</strong> This chapter felt a little long to me. I kept thinking, yeah we know this already, I’m ready for something to happen. Not like an action scene or anything. But nothing really happened. This is about the only thing I thought of that I found interesting. Egwene thinks that now she can pass on more of Moghedien's secrets: weaving disguises, cloaking ability to channel. They already passed on Traveling. She tells Leane to tell Faolain and Theodrin to ask around camp if anyone has seen a strange man… Aran’gar (Balthamel). Also Egwene learned to Skim from Mogi. The Salidar Aes Sedai have a Gateway space in each camp they build. And Nicola and Ariena try to blackmail Egwene. Egwene can’t go to Rand because of Tower Law. Did I miss anything? </p>

        <h2>Ch 10, Unseen Eyes, TAR</h2>
        <p><strong>Egwene.</strong> I want to jump to Callandor. WHO IS GOING TO PICK IT UP AND FOLLOW RAND WHEN THEY PICK IT UP?!?! Could it be a Male Forsaken, or now we have the Asha'man - that technically follow Rand... but maybe they follow Taim more than Rand??? Okay, that's all on Callandor. I am concerned. I am concerned with all these "unseen eyes" watching Egwene. Someone literally outside her tent, then the people in the Stone of Tear.. goodness, stop going to the same place for these meetings. Egwene thinks her mother Marin would let her marry Gawyn, nice! Ogier stedding can't be entered in TAR. Logain is going to the Black Tower... sweet! I look forward to that! </p>

        <p>And dreams! Egwene interpreted one of her own dreams of Gawyn becoming her Warder.. nice! Dreaming and Dreamwalking have nothing to do with the One Power - that's interesting and cool! Like Min's viewings! I wonder if other people have that ability? Gawyn dreams, a wall of seals that she cannot tear down... I do wonder if there are just a stockpile of fake seals, maybe. Mat grabs an illuminator's firework and doesn't die, but men *will die* because of this... whoa. Egwene's head about to be chopped. Logain laughing over Rand's dead body, oh oh, and Logain stepping onto a black stone.... the Black Tower podium?! and Rand's face is like a puppet. Hawk (berelain) with man dying (perrin, I guess). Dark young man holds a brightly shining object (callendor).</p>

        <h2>Ch 11, An Oath, Women</h2>
        <p><strong>Egwene.</strong> Faolain chose Blue. Theodrin chose Brown. They spoke to people and they say they saw Halima outside Mogi’s tent. Siuan has been in TAR looking for Mogi and finds nothing. Siuan still wants to be the head of eyes and ears of Blue. Lelaine and Romanda complain that Delana wants Elaida declared as Black Ajah. Egwene says no. Egwene goes with Siuan, Myrelle, and Bryne to something that Bryne wants Egwene to see. </p>

        <h2>Ch 12, A Morning of Victory, Forsnaken</h2>
        <p><strong>Egwene.</strong> This was a long chapter. I'm **very** interested in this Halima / Egwene relationship. It seems Egwene has no worry towards Halima. Also, headaches began the day after Logain escaped, the first time she talked to Halima... What could Halima be doing to Egwene?? Halima (Aran'gar - Balthamel). LAN! Whoa, Lan is going to be in Ebou Dar with Nynaeve, yes yes yes! That's great! I look forward to seeing that play out. I'm also loving Egwene going at these Aes Sedai because she *is* the Amyrlin.. whoa, awesome! I do appreciate that Moiriane and Myrelle spoke and Myrelle was going to pass the bond to Nynaeve, good. Mat's army is growing to ten thousand, a similar number to Bryne's army, and Bryne's army is **for Egwene**. That's great! Right? Alright, reading on!</p>

        <h2>Ch 13, The Bowl of the Winds, SeaFolk</h2>
        <p><strong>Aviendha.</strong> SEA FOLK SEA FOLK! Oh wow, I love the Sea Folk. A little sketchy, but I want to know so much more about them. Also, Aviendha is having a world of trouble with all this water around.. lol. Also, aslo, this Bowl of the Winds seems like it is going to take a **loooong time** to find. I'm interested in Elayne and Aviendha adopting each other as first-sisters. Rand was Aivendha's first lover, wink. Come on girls, just have Mat help you all. Sea Folk!</p>

        <h2>Ch 14, White Plumes, Dice</h2>
        <p><strong>Mat.</strong> Go Olver! Okay, so Mat sees the woman who tried to kill Rand and Mat from TEOTW?! WHOA! What a callback! Okay, Mat also sees a white haired old man with a hooked nose. Mat has lost a lot of memories that have been filled, I feel like he's close to remembering Birgitte... lol, hopefully. Mat stops at a ring shop while following this woman, and the ring doesn't come off until Mat pays for it... should I pay attention to this ring?? HMM. And this Palace is Jaichim Carridin's Palace, at least I assume that is what "let to Jaichim Carridin" means. Whoa. Then the white haired man is gone.... spooky. Dice rolling in Mat's head! </p>

        <h2>Ch 15, Insects, Forsnaken</h2>
        <p><strong>Carridin.</strong> Carridin still thinks Niall is alive... and this White Plumes woman is Mili Skane a saddler's daughter near Whitebridge. She went to the White Tower and couldn't learn so she became a Friend of the Dark, her words. She's killed twenty people in seven years. She is an assassin and hunter. She leads a circle and reports to Carridin. And anoterh high Darkfriend reporting to him is a one eyed beggar named Old Cully. WHOA! SAMMAEL!! Also holy cow, this vision after seeing Mat and this Darkfriend social vision with Mat and horn and dagger and whoa! How is that possible?? Okay back to Sammael, whoa. All this about Fades and Trollocs and how they eat and kill people... dark. And oh no, Carridin's sister Vanora. Sammael is going to send... *someone* to deal with Nynaeve, Elayne, and Aviendha. Carridin asked a favor of Sammael.. hmm. Carridin's whole family is dead now.. and WHOA DOES CARRIDIN RIP IT TO SHIAINE! Also, Sammael opens a gateway to a place with gray columns and mist.. Illian right? Shiaine wakes and calls Carridin Bors and he wants her to put all her efforts in finding Mat. He has other darkfriends looking for the stash of angreal, ter'angreal, and sa'angreal. This turned out to be a good chapter.</p>

        <h2>Ch 16, A Touch of the Cheek, Flame of Tar Valon</h2>
        <p><strong>Mat.</strong> Whoa! Mat has gotten himself into something.. whoa. Mat goes into the Tarasin Palace and he gets passed around all these people to get up to see Nynave and Elayne or send them a message. Then Joline and Teslyn catch up to him (Elaida's), and they really want Mat because he's ta'veren. There are nine Aes Sedai in the palace, Nynaeve, Elayne, Joline, Teslyn, Adeleas, Vandene, Merilille, Sareitha, and one more. Then Joline, Teslyn, Addeleas, Sareitha, and Merilille argue over Mat. Then Laren reappears from a summons to Queen Tylin to Mat. Mat enters and speaks Old Tongue. Mat writes a note to the girls about Darkfriends and Carridin and seals it with his new ring! The Ring is engraved with a border of large crescents and a running fox that seemed to have startled two birds in flight! Nice! Lucky Mat picked up that ring because that's so important to Mat... ta'veren! Tylin doesn't react Carridin being a darkfriend. Tylin really **wants** Mat.. whoa. whoa! Then Tylin's son comes in, Beslan, and Tylin wants him to befriend Mat and go to some festivals in Ebou Dar. Whoa!</p>

        <h2>Ch 17, The Triumph of Logic, Woman</h2>
        <p><strong>Mat.</strong> OH OH! Multiple perspectives! Mat is in the Wandering Woman, and Mat orders Vanin to check out the Chelsaine Palace. There is a report of a bubble of evil fog in Rahand that mangled people. A serving girl says an Illuminator is looking for Mat. While, Mat is also looking for an Illuminator... Aludra! Mat goes upstairs and is attacked by two men, quickly killed by Mat. Setalle and Jasfer Anan say the men checed in with a big chest and they said they were on their way to Nor Chasen. Mat's dice haven't stopped yet. Mat finds a note in his pocket and it says "Elayne and Nynaeve are pushing too far. They are still in danger from the Tower. Warn them to be careful, or they will be kneeling to Elaida." - it is written on fine snowy white paper. Mat thinks it was Joline and Teslyn to leave the note.... MY GUESS it was Vandene? no... maybe! Next perspective!</p>

        <p><strong>Joline.</strong> I love this.. the only hope against the Dark One is a boy who is running wild... hah Rand! Joline is loyal to the White Tower, not Elaida. Teslyn says Elaida called Joline a child. Joline is upset because she is older than Elaida's mother. Teslyn wants to take Elayne, Nynaeve, Mat, and Aviendha to Elaida. Joline wants to depose Elaida too. </p>

        <p><strong>Falion.</strong> Whoa! YEESH, Falion is with Ispan of the Blue Ajah.. but they're BLACK AJAH! They're looking for this cache of angreal, ter'angreal, and sa'angreal... just like the other Forsaken. UH OH! Falion is White Ajah.. cough, black ajah. Callie a Wise Woman was kicked out of the White Tower four years ago and tried to steal a ter'angreal to make flowers and the sound of a waterfall. Mogi hasn't talked to Falion in a while, not even in TAR. Falion suggests kidnapping Nynaeve and Elayne. Ispan wants to kill them. WHOA!</p>

        <p>WHO WAS THAT? Was this that Old Cully? This person was near where where Falion and Ispan are staying and then Arnin and Nad (the guys who were disposing of the body from Falion's perspective) walk out with a wheel barrow. He can't remember a lot, but his head hurts and he can't remember much. </p>
