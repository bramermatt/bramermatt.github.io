        <p>I'm really happy to be back reading the Wheel of Time. Make sure to check out my <a href="../../html/reviews/franchise/wheel-of-time-in-review.html">Wheel of Time in Review</a>!</p>

        <p>I am currently reading, as of June 5, 2023, so this is going to be a review in progress! And below, I'm going to have notes as I read, by chapter. More than likely spoilers, so I'm going to keep those hidden by the box below. When I've finished my read, the Notes box will be moved below the spoiler box, probably past the score!</p>

            <p>And here we are. Six books in and we keep building! Robert Jordan has outdone himself, these characters are so incredibly deep. The world is vast and the named characters are getting extravagant.</p>

            <p>This book is a bit violent and dark. I’m so excited to continue this series! 9 more books to go!</p> 
                
            <p>This is my favorite book in the series so far. There is a lot of story left, many story threads left open and there is a building of a villain coming back and so much more.</p>
                
            <p>This, I believe is the longest book in the series, at 1,015 pages. It took me over a month to read, a lot of family things happening in that time, so it didn’t feel very long.</p>
                
            <p>You’re going to love it!</p>

        <p>And now I'm adding in predictions for upcoming books and more! Check that out below.</p>

        <summary style="background-color:rgb(27, 86, 105);">Notes As I Read</summary>
   
        <h2>Prologue, Lightnings, Wheel and Snake</h2>
        <p><strong>Elaida.</strong> Okay, let's talk her own Palace as Amyrlin.. weird right? She asked the neareset stedding: Stedding Jentoine in the Black Hills for help and they declined. Her clock was commissioned by Cemaile Sorenthaine, raised from the Gray Ajah three hundred years ago. Now, a lot of news in the world, but what I really care about it the note from Galina that say's Rand has been haptured.. hmm, sorry Elaida he broke free! I look forward to seeing that realization. Next, notes of Elayne, Nynaeve and *two others* in Ebou Dar (Aviendha and Birgitte). Elaida tells Alviarin to send order to Teslyn and Joline to capture the girls with forkroot again. A Green Ajah agent in Caemlyn reports four hundred men in the Black Tower.. WOO! SO MANY ASHA'MAN! Interesting the Red Ajah have only found twenty-four in the last twenty years, maybe because they can't test them? I'm not sure. Elaida learned about Egwene, and she wants to increase the White Tower Guard because of the supposed twenty thousand men Gareth Bryne is bringin to the White Tower. I look forward to seeing this.. if it happens!</p>

        <p>Elaida has a Fortelling.. "The White Tower will be whole again, except for remnants cast out and scorned, whole and stronger than ever. Rand al'Thor will face the Amyrlin and know her anger. The Black Tower will be rent in blood and fire, and sisters will walk its grounds. This I Foretell." So, this will come true, because it's a Fortelling.. right? But that doesn't mean all will happen like Elaida expects. Like the White Tower whole again: yeah, Egwene as Amylin (my guess). Rand will face Amyrlin and know her anger: Egwene. Black Tower rent with blood and sisters walk its ground: Sisters killed by the Black Tower (that's what I hope, but this could go the way it says). Which, I don't want the Black Tower gone, but we'll see.</p>

        <p><strong>Sevanna.</strong> Hey, cool, Dumai's Wells from Sevanna's perspective. Is there more to say then Sevanna still has this box that is supposed to help her take Rand? This was great to see another perspective!</p>

        <p><strong>Alviarin.</strong> Hey hey, this is cool! So, I'm *really* interested in this now! Masaana in the White tower, hiding her ability to channel... inverted weaves (right?)! So, Ishamael made Alviarin the head of the Black Ajah?! WHOA! Lanfear and Graendal have visited the White Tower, and Be'lal yanked Alviarin out of her sleep to *some strange place*... oh oh! Apparently Elaida's orders were to kidnap the King of Illian and the Queen of Saldea, and offer kingship of Tear to High Lord Darlin.. but does she even have the power to do that? I like Mesaana's "you children almost match the ajah at times"... could that be the Ajahs from the AOL? A Great Council of Thirteen heas the Black Ajah... spooky! I LOVE IT! Mesaana doesn't care about the Black Tower. Mesaana also warns Alviarin to only serve her, not Semirhage, Demandred, or Graendal. MESAANA TEACHES ALVIARIN HOW TO TRAVEL! I'm so excited about this. BLACK AJAH PLOT! BLACK AJAH PLOT!</p>

        <p><strong>Pedron Niall.</strong> WHOA! Niall has been stabbed by Omerna?! WHOA! Then Eamon Valda killed Omerna for treason! Faisar's message to Niall was confirming the Seanchan invasion in Tarabon. Also, Morgase really wants to see Galad. IS NIALL GOING TO DIE? Reading on!</p>

        <p><strong>Eamon Valda.</strong> Pedron Niall is dead. Wow. You know, for the horrible crew the Whitecloaks are, I liked the sneaky Pedron Niall. But here we go. Eamon Valda will be Lord Captain Commander. Valda really wants Morgase, to kill her since she's a *witch*. And Valda doesn't like Balwer. Wow.</p>

        <p><strong>Gawyn.</strong> We're back at Dumai's Wells. Gawyn wishes he killed Rand, he keeps thinking that. Gawyn also sees an Aes Sedai fall, and we don't know who this is. I can't think of who this might be.. could be Galina if she knows how to Travel?? Since she is gone when Gawyn gets there? Maybe. Then some more Aiel come to fight with Gawyn's 200 Younglings Gawyn killed 4 Aiel and that's cool, go Gawyn. The Younglings start to make camp, and plan to head back to Tar Valon.</p>

        <p>Okay, that's the Prologue.. very good! Here we go to A Crown of Swords!</p>
