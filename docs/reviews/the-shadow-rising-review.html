    <blockquote>The Dragon Reborn by Robert Jordan (Book Three in the Wheel of Time) - Book Review on YouTube</blockquote> -->

    <h2 id="written">[in progress]</h2>
    <p>I am currently reading, as of February 13, 2023, and I'm no where near being done - so this is going to be a review in progress! And below, I'm going to have notes as I read, by chapter. More than likely spoilers, so I'm going to keep those hidden by the box below. When I've finished my read, the Notes box will be moved below the spoiler box, probably past the score!</p>

    <details id="spoilers" style="border-color: rgb(27, 86, 105);">
        <summary style="background-color:rgb(27, 86, 105);">Notes As I Read</summary>
        <h2>Chapter 1 - Seeds of Shadow</h2>
        <p>Min's back! And she's made it to White Tower (finally - we were waiting all of The Dragon Reborn (3) to find out where Min was). I've only read 14 pages right now, this first chapter is 40 pages long.. Okay, I've read some more now, Min got to talk to Siuan, and it seems Min is going to stay in the White Tower.</p>
        
        <p>Now we're follow Elaida and apparenlty she can Foretell. I'm trying to remember, but isn't it important that Moiraine's last name is Damodred? Doesn't that have something to do with Andor - and the recent Kings? Ahh, Elaida is talking to Alvarin (white) now.. obviously not hiding any thoughts about Rand..</p>
        
        <p>Now we’re following Bornhald and Ordieth is FAIN! And terrifying. And they’re so close to the Two Rivers.. at Terran Ferry (I’m happy to be back, but wish it were under better circumstances).</p>
        
        <p>Now we’re following Suroth, of the SEANCHAN and Book Two - so it’s been some time. And she is just fun to read. So “powerful”, right? I think. I’m not sure, maybe it’s just because for so long she’s been in a station of power that she thinks she can be over the sul’dom and d’amane. Scary stuff.</p>        
        
        <p>Finally done with chapter one and I can’t wait to read more!</p>
        
        <h2>Chapter 2 - Whirlpools in the Pattern</h2>
        <p>Perrin and Faile, okay I love to see this. Their relationship has gotten a lot closer since TDR. Also, this axe? What happened there - I’m sure we’ll find out. Also just thinking back on Min’s visions of the Aes Sedai and the killing, when will we see that? I have no idea when that would happen or how that would even happen and by who?! I love the Perrin and Faile relationship.</p>
        
        <p>Mat, ah Mat. I just love reading Mat chapters now. Mat is gambling with the Aiel and it’s fun to read for sure. The COCK CROWED. This was a great scene with Mat and how good he is with knives and how many knives he has like Thom! A great scene. Mat is awesome.</p>
        
        <p>Rand… YES! I’m so glad that we are getting Rand chapters again. This was an awesome scene. Berelain trying to be sexy haha. And I was certain Rand was going to do something with Berelain, but obviously not! So, the cock crowed again.. I loved this. This was another awesome scene. We are getting so many awesome scenes already. This is so good.</p>
        
        <h2>Chapter 3 - Reflection</h2>
        <p>This is some of the best Wheel of Time that I have read. This is amazing. Rand is hurt and Perrin is there to help, and Moraine and Lan, and some Aiel, and the Prophesies. This is just so good. I am blown away by this book so far. Emotional impact at a 5 right now for me. Plot a 5 as well, so far.</p>
        
        <h2>Chapter 4 - Strings</h2>
        <p>Mat and Thom, back again! Wow do I love the Wheel of Time and this book. This is so much fun to read, I've read so much of these characters - I feel like I know them and it's so great. Alright, Mat is t'averen and wow so much is happening. I believe that this bubble is happening because the boys are t'averen; it's gotta be. Because these things only happened to the three boys. Oh oh, and Thom still playing the Game of Houses... I am really enjoying that!</p>

        <h2>Chapter 5 - Questioners</h2>
        <p>I tell you what, this book just won't quit. BANGER after BANGER of chapters. The hits keep coming. This is so good. Okay, we've got Egwene and Nynaeve completely taking over Amico and Joiya (I'm sure that's hard for Egwene), and it's great to see. But let's talk about this plan that Joiya brings up because, oh wow does that seem scary and completely possible to happen. Where is Liandrin (we don't know!), and can she really do this with Mazrim Taim? I don't think Joiya is lying at all, because this plan is FLESHED OUT. There is not.. "uh and this", it is "1,2,3, and Rand a'l Thor, and The Dragon Reborn, and 4,5..." wow. This is good. Well, bad for Rand, but good for the story!</p>

        <h2>Chapter 6 - Doorways</h2>
        <p>A great chapter, not much action, but a great time. Moiraine talking of Prophecies and what they are all to do. And more talk of sa'angrael, and ter', and angraels. So cool. I really like this magic system and this world is so big and I'm so excited to read more!</p>

        <h2>Chapter 7 - Playing With Fire</h2>
        <p>This was a nice chapter. We got some saidin and saidar work and that was awesome to see. I really appreciate how Rand is not mad yet, I love to see him acting as we got in TEOTW and TGH - it is great for me and great for the story. Although I have no idea when the madness is going to come to pass. I love Elayne and Egwene, and I'm happy to see them trying to help Rand - because someone needs to. There really needs to be someone to come around Rand and help him figure it out and it cannot be Balzamon.... oh no, we haven't gotten any dream sequences yet - I'm sure we are gearing up for a big one soon. Onto the next chapter now!</p>

        <h2>Chapter 8 - Hard Heads</h2>
        <p>Alright Elayne and Rand! I SHIP! Love these two together and I really love how RJ wrote this scene. It was very genuine and I appreciated it a lot. Also, I love how Rand is when it comes to these High Lords. Really holding his own! And Mat and Egwene… okay, so Egwene and Elayne have started (I guess it’s not just been this book but..) doing things very brashly and without concern for the consequences- last chapter I was actually worried they might accidentally still Rand or something… obviously not, I’m on book four. But still, and the same with this chapter. Egwene is just telling Mat about the doorway after Moiraine told her not to tell anyone! Ahh! But still loving the book and excited to see what happens next!</p>

        <h2>Chapter 9 - Decisions</h2>
        <p>Okay, before I talk about Chapter 9, I must ask a question.. is there anything on the planet that is better than the Wheel of Time? I mean, any book series, any TV show, any movie franchise? Anything? Because I currently can think of nothing that is better than this book series. Wow, I am enthralled and cannot take my eyes of these pages. Wow.</p>

        <p>Okay, a lot here.. this chapter actually jumped around a bit with no breaks for perspective changes, so that was a little jarring but whoa a lot here. Okay, Mat is going down to the docks (definitely not leaving), Perrin is trying to find a way out for Faile (I can't wait for another Perrin chapter), Egwene isn't learning anything new from Joiya and Amico, Nynaeve is spending as much time as possible with Lan (SHIP!), and Elayne and Rand are spending as much time as possible (SHIP!) - love that!, and Rand continuing to be awesome in the face of these High Lords, and now.. Lanfear. Whoa. Okay, let's chat.</p>

        <p>Forsaken are now "Chosen" - I like that! I think I'd heard that before so I was a little spoiled, but that's okay because this is an awesome reveal of Lanfear coming out to Rand about her whole plan. I'm very interested to see what happens with Rand and Asmodean (I've also been spoiled about him.. but I won't spoil here), and this is just a great scene all together. Rand (LTT) and Lanfear, wow. I am at a lose for words, this is so good! I really appreciate the story progression here. I'm glad Rand knows who Selene is now and this is just a great story that I'm excited to see unfold in many more books! I can't believe there are so many more books truly - this is amazing. And then the Gray Man comes in the room... oh no! I have glanced at the next chapter and I see that some Aiel are dead.. oh no..</p>
