<h2 id="written">Written Review</h2>
<p>My PERFECT GAME would be a modern day, third person shooter, with a heavy driving dynamic. I almost found everything I've always wanted with Watchdogs but sadly I haven't found that PERFECT GAME just yet. Here is why Watchdogs isn't my perfect game, the story didn't keep me entertained throughout the whole game. And watchdogs wasn't an experience that really resonated with me. Some titles that have resonated with me in the past are Portal 2, Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2, Sleeping Dogs, Euro Truck Simulator 2, Minecraft, Terraway. I have a deep connection with all of those games that I will never forget. Watchdogs on the other hand can be forgotten. I enjoyed the game don't get me wrong, I just wished I enjoyed it more than I did.</p>

<p>Gang Hideouts - Very fun, probably the most fun side mission through the whole game.</p>

<p>Story - Strong start, slowed down less intriguing middle, not so satisfying ending.</p>

<p>Let's get right into the ending, there were at least four times where I was like, "here come the credits", but no the black screen kept coloring back into to continue the story. The final "boss" battle with Damien and Jordi ended with a sort of quick time event. Now I only noticed a few times where this was a necessity to have a quick time event. Once with Iraq and his dog tags, the ending, and Clara's final scene. I could've used a better and bigger battle between Jordi and Damien and Aiden.</p>

<p>(Aiden Story - I enjoyed the ride that Watchdogs took me on through the eyes of Aiden Pearce. Even though Aiden was the least interesting character in the whole universe. With such a bold statement, I would've liked Clara's story from her perspective more than Aidenâ€™s. She seemed to have an even shadier past than any other character. Even with Aiden's character I still found enjoyment with his ark from sane to insane with rage and revenge fueling his every move.</p>

<p>(Maurice story - I would've liked more action with him, I didn't like how bit by bit we got of that story. Maybe we could've had a better conclusion than the SPOILER full circle we got to conclude the game. My first Playthrough I chose to kill Maurice. My second Playthrough I let him live. I enjoyed the second ending better with leaving a "new start" for Maurice and Aiden.)</p>

<p>(Iraq story - I found Iraq's story more interesting than any other of the three main "villains". Iraq had the most unique layout of his building. I used a lot of grenades in the hallways when an elite got in my way. This is when the grenade launcher came in handy. His final battle scene seemed to give me the most trouble. I died at least 3 times on my second Playthrough. After I died I didn't like that I had to sit there and listen to Iraq and Aiden banter every single time. The spastic placement of the enforcer gave me much trouble. Once Iraq showed up I blasted him once with my grenade launcher and hit him a few times with my shotgun and he was dead.)</p>

<p>(Lucky Quinn story - I enjoyed how intertwined Lucky Quinn was with every other character and their story. I could've gone without the nudity though. Although if the nudity was taken out we wouldn't have the exposition of Lucky Quinn's involvement with the characters of the Chicago South Club. I was so satisfied with his death scene. I felt so power as Aiden with each click of Quinn's pacemaker.)</p>

<p>Driving - Fluid - Some cars such as "budget" seem slippery to drive.</p>

<p>Shooting - Very Good - I mostly used the silenced pistol and sniper rifle throughout the whole game. When I reached the mission in which more firepower was needed I purchased the grenade launcher which came in handy later in the game as well. I used the AK-47 as my assault rifle. I also found a semi-automatic shotgun later in the game that was more efficient than the shotgun I had been using previously throughout the game.</p>

<p>Musical Score - (Driving Music - I didn't care much for most of the songs on the playlist. The only few songs that found my interest were, Diane Young by Vampire Weekend and Panic by ON AN ON. The rest of the playlist I could've done without. Now to my knowledge I think the old-timey-classic music fit if I were just driving around and doing nothing else but driving. The songs I previously mentioned get me hyped and excited to do missions and keep me interested in the task at hand.)</p>

<p>(Theatrical Music - Wonderful score, very dark and luminous when necessary, yet light and happy when necessary. I also enjoyed when a mission required the theatrical music instead of the driving music. I especially liked the mission with T-Bone and his art. The loud rock music coupled with explosions and gun fire was just perfect. Now the final score with one of the closing scenes with Clara really gripped me to my chair. I felt every deep swirl of the cellos with every breathe on screen.)</p>
