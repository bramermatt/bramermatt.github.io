<h2>Spoilers Ahead</h2>
<p>I am saying these <a href="#notes">Notes as I Read</a> are going to be spoilers if you've not read Winter's Heart yet! Please read at your own digression.</p>

<div class="ad-break">
    <h1>Before You Proceed</h1>
    <p>There is a particular aspect to spoilers that I prefer to make known to you.</p> 
    <p>If you don't want to see the spoilers, you won't see them. There is a clear break when spoilers begin and they are typically separated by a <strong style="color:red;">RED</strong> box with the words "Spoilers".</p>
    <p>If you'd prefer not to read them, don't! More power to you. But, thank you for reading as you do.</p>

    <p>"The seals that hold back night shall weaken, and in the heart of winter shall winter's heart be born amid the wailing of lamentations and the gnashing of teeth, for winter's heart shall ride a black horse, and the name of it is Death. — from The Karaethon Cycle: The Prophecies of the Dragon"</p>

    <h2>Prologue</h2>
    <h2>Snow, Wheel and Snake</h2>
    <p><strong>Seaine.</strong>  A continuation from The Path of Daggers interegation scene with the Sitters. Gotta love these names.. Seaine, Saerin, Pevara, Yukiri, and Doesine are in the second basement of the White Tower. Seaine is using an eavesdropping weave to make sure they aren't disturbed. Saerin is in charge. They're questioning Talene with the Chair of Remore, a ter'angreal that recreates the consequences of one's crimes.. AWESOME! Talene cracks she forswears her Black Ajah oaths on the Oath Rod and literally has a seizure, then reswears the Three Oaths. And swears to obey the other five. Talene admits to being BA then says Elaida is BA. Not true! It's Alviarin! They all decide to keep this a secret and Pevara tells about Zerah, Bernaile, and the other eight moles from Salidar. They want them to swear oaths to this crew.. Neat! A fun start! Intrigue!</p>

    <p><strong>Elayne.</strong> Good gracious, this was a lot! I loved Dylin saying "is the whole world going to come in here".. hahah! Alright! Elayne is in the Royal Palace with Dylin and Birgitte. Birgitte is now Captain General of the Queen's Guards, awesome. The story is Birgitte is from Kandor. Nynaeve and Vandene aren't back yet. They are making arrangements with Reanne to rescue the Kin trapped in Seanchan territory. Vandene is trying to find Adeleas' killer. Birgitte is recruiting mercenaries, since armsmen from Elayne's estates aren't there yet. Dyline and Birgitte odn't get along. Some politics insune on who is siding with Elayne, turns out only a few. Birgitte says Gawyn will come, Elayne sent three couriers to TV with messages for him. Then two Sea Folk come in, Renaile din Calon and Zaida din Parede Blackwing, and Merlille. The SF are angry with Elayne for not providing more teachers - their bargain. Elayne suggests they go to Tear wtih the SF ships, but Zaida declines saying they are going to wait for Rand. Elayne and Zaida make a new bargain using Sareitha and Careane might be able to help. MORE MORE MORE. Reene Harfor (Elayne's First Maid - also Kinswomen), saying Taim is here. Taim enters.. this is so cool. Taim is portrayed as terrifying here, with two Asha'man. Whoa! Elayne links with Merilille and Renaile. Elayne wishes she had one of the thre angreal from ED. Zaida and Birgitte draw their knives. Taim tells Elayne that Rand sent her a gift from the south, and Taim will deliver later. Elayne demands that Taim let her guards into the BT. Taim agrees but with escorts. Elayne says they will come everyday and she will come too. THEN THEN THEN. Nadere comes and summons Elayne to her first-sister ceremony with Avi. THIS WAS AWESOME! Elayne was told to strip right there and it was awesome to see the women protect Elayne from those stinky men.. lol. Nadere takes her to a room with a dozen WOs and Avi. Amys, Tamela, Viendre, Monaelle, and Shyanda. Tamela and Viendre are stronger in the OP than Elayne, but Monaelle is in charge. Amys must've Travelled from Cairhien - Egwene taugh the WOs for them teaching her lessons about TAR. Elayne wishes Melaine were here but Monaelle tells them that channeling involved would be a risk to her babies. Elayne asks about the bond with Birgitte and Monaelele respons with "probs not". No, she says she might feel a little. The ceremony insues and Elayne and Avi are given to each other by surrogate mothers and they must name the most and least favorite things about each other, then a slap fight, then they hug. The WOs channel and something like a Warder bond forms between Elayne and Avi - they are first-sisters. WHOA! THIS WAS AWESOME!</p>

    <p><strong>Toveine.</strong> The Aes Sedai Logain bonded in TPOD. Sweet! Glad we get this perspective! There are 51 captive Aes Sedai in the BT now, including Akoure, Desandre, Jenare, Lemai, Carniele, and Ayako. They all blame Toveine for their perdicament. The Asha'man are building a perimeter wall around a four square mile area - there are now about 500 Asha'man! WOW! Toveine sees five Asha'man escorting a dozen Andoran Queen's Guards and Elayne and Birgitte! That was fast! The Asha'man, whose name we don't know, is bulky-middle years with oily hair, an oily smile, augur-like eyes, and an Illianer accent. Toveine feels Logain's pull and goes to his house. Gabrelle, the other AS he bonded, spent the night with him ;). There are several Dedicated waiting on Logain, Evin Vinchova, Donalo Sandomere, Androl Genhald, Mezar Kurin, and Canler. Vinchova reports that the Tow Rivers men are a problem, two are fourteen (THE PRICKLY BUSH THAT TAIM WAS TALKING AOBUT!) Donalo reports that Mishraile is receiving private lessons from Taim.. hmm. Welyn Kajima, Dedicated, runs up that Taim is back from Cairhien and posted new deserters, seven full Asha'man: Gedwyn, Torval, Rochaid, Kisman, Dashiva, Flinn, Hopwil, and Narishma. Logain tels Toveine and Gabrelle to go inside and he heads off with the Dedicated. Gabrelle says she's learned that all the full AM but Logain live in Taim's palace. Logain found Toveine's orders and burned them. One order was Elaida's to gentle and hang every man found. Gabrelle convices Toveine the captured AS must put their differences aside and stand united. Desandre and Lemai have the highest standing. Toveine agrees to submit. </p>

    <p><strong>Rand.</strong> WHOA! Let's go. Rand is in the City in Cairhien. People are working to clear rubble around the Sun Palace. Rand is back in the city at the Acadamy - this is awesome! Min, Dobraine, and Idrien are here. Rand can feel Alanna sulking. Min wanted to get some of Herid Fel's books. Dobraine tells Rand that some people think he is dead or kidnapped again. People think the attack was Forsaken or Aes Sedai. Dobraine tells Rand that Flinn, Narishma, and Hopwil are still in the Sun Palace. Ailil and Shalon have *disappeared* lol Rand trapped them under the beds. Rand told Dobraine that Cadsuane is probably holding them like she is holding Caraline Damodred and Darlin Sisnera. In the courtyard below, Mervin Poel's steamwagon beings moving under its own power and Rand is shocked! Idrien tells Rand about the other accomplishments at the school. Kin Tovere has finished his telescope, Maryl Harke has built a glider, Jander Parentakis has built a riverboat with waterwheels, Ryn Anhara has built a lightning jar, and there is mention of Niko Tokama. LTT mumbles to Rand and says "I thought I could build, I was wrong. We are not builders, not you, or I, or the other one. We are destroyers" WHAT?! WHO?! THE OTHER ONE?! HMMMM. Anyway, Rand has decided who will rule Cairhien and Tear, Rand gives Dobraine two packets - one for instructions for Dobraine as a steward for Cairhien. He also tells Dobraine to push for Elayne when she claims the Sun Throne. And he tells Dobraine to deliver the second packet when it is appropriate. Rand has a third packet in his pocket for Gregoin as steward of Illian. Dobraine and Idrien leave and Rand gets dizzy. He is used to them when channeling but this is the first time without saidin. Rand then opens a gateway to a clearing 500 miles away from Cairien, closer to TV. Yesterday Rand Traveled to Rhuidean where Rand asked about Shara, then Traveled to Tear and Rand asked about Chachin. He is trying to keep people off his real track. Rand has a bag with him that still has two ter'angreal (has to be those statues), but only Rand can use the male statue.. so maybe Nynaeve but that's difficult because he doesn't know where she is.. hmm. Then Rand tells Min that he plans to cleanse the taint on saidin! But first, he must kill Dashiva and the others...... WOW. I FEEL LIKE WE ARE SO CLOSE TO THIS!</p>
