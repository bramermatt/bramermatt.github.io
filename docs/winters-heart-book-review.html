        <p>"The seals that hold back night shall weaken, and in the heart of winter shall winter's heart be born amid the wailing of lamentations and the gnashing of teeth, for winter's heart shall ride a black horse, and the name of it is Death. — from The Karaethon Cycle: The Prophecies of the Dragon"</p>
    
        <h2>Prologue</h2>
        <h2>Snow, Wheel and Snake</h2>
        <p><strong>Seaine.</strong>  A continuation from The Path of Daggers interegation scene with the Sitters. Gotta love these names.. Seaine, Saerin, Pevara, Yukiri, and Doesine are in the second basement of the White Tower. Seaine is using an eavesdropping weave to make sure they aren't disturbed. Saerin is in charge. They're questioning Talene with the Chair of Remore, a ter'angreal that recreates the consequences of one's crimes.. AWESOME! Talene cracks she forswears her Black Ajah oaths on the Oath Rod and literally has a seizure, then reswears the Three Oaths. And swears to obey the other five. Talene admits to being BA then says Elaida is BA. Not true! It's Alviarin! They all decide to keep this a secret and Pevara tells about Zerah, Bernaile, and the other eight moles from Salidar. They want them to swear oaths to this crew.. Neat! A fun start! Intrigue!</p>
    
        <p><strong>Elayne.</strong> Good gracious, this was a lot! I loved Dylin saying "is the whole world going to come in here".. hahah! Alright! Elayne is in the Royal Palace with Dylin and Birgitte. Birgitte is now Captain General of the Queen's Guards, awesome. The story is Birgitte is from Kandor. Nynaeve and Vandene aren't back yet. They are making arrangements with Reanne to rescue the Kin trapped in Seanchan territory. Vandene is trying to find Adeleas' killer. Birgitte is recruiting mercenaries, since armsmen from Elayne's estates aren't there yet. Dyline and Birgitte odn't get along. Some politics insune on who is siding with Elayne, turns out only a few. Birgitte says Gawyn will come, Elayne sent three couriers to TV with messages for him. Then two Sea Folk come in, Renaile din Calon and Zaida din Parede Blackwing, and Merlille. The SF are angry with Elayne for not providing more teachers - their bargain. Elayne suggests they go to Tear wtih the SF ships, but Zaida declines saying they are going to wait for Rand. Elayne and Zaida make a new bargain using Sareitha and Careane might be able to help. MORE MORE MORE. Reene Harfor (Elayne's First Maid - also Kinswomen), saying Taim is here. Taim enters.. this is so cool. Taim is portrayed as terrifying here, with two Asha'man. Whoa! Elayne links with Merilille and Renaile. Elayne wishes she had one of the thre angreal from ED. Zaida and Birgitte draw their knives. Taim tells Elayne that Rand sent her a gift from the south, and Taim will deliver later. Elayne demands that Taim let her guards into the BT. Taim agrees but with escorts. Elayne says they will come everyday and she will come too. THEN THEN THEN. Nadere comes and summons Elayne to her first-sister ceremony with Avi. THIS WAS AWESOME! Elayne was told to strip right there and it was awesome to see the women protect Elayne from those stinky men.. lol. Nadere takes her to a room with a dozen WOs and Avi. Amys, Tamela, Viendre, Monaelle, and Shyanda. Tamela and Viendre are stronger in the OP than Elayne, but Monaelle is in charge. Amys must've Travelled from Cairhien - Egwene taugh the WOs for them teaching her lessons about TAR. Elayne wishes Melaine were here but Monaelle tells them that channeling involved would be a risk to her babies. Elayne asks about the bond with Birgitte and Monaelele respons with "probs not". No, she says she might feel a little. The ceremony insues and Elayne and Avi are given to each other by surrogate mothers and they must name the most and least favorite things about each other, then a slap fight, then they hug. The WOs channel and something like a Warder bond forms between Elayne and Avi - they are first-sisters. WHOA! THIS WAS AWESOME!</p>
    
        <p><strong>Toveine.</strong> The Aes Sedai Logain bonded in TPOD. Sweet! Glad we get this perspective! There are 51 captive Aes Sedai in the BT now, including Akoure, Desandre, Jenare, Lemai, Carniele, and Ayako. They all blame Toveine for their perdicament. The Asha'man are building a perimeter wall around a four square mile area - there are now about 500 Asha'man! WOW! Toveine sees five Asha'man escorting a dozen Andoran Queen's Guards and Elayne and Birgitte! That was fast! The Asha'man, whose name we don't know, is bulky-middle years with oily hair, an oily smile, augur-like eyes, and an Illianer accent. Toveine feels Logain's pull and goes to his house. Gabrelle, the other AS he bonded, spent the night with him ;). There are several Dedicated waiting on Logain, Evin Vinchova, Donalo Sandomere, Androl Genhald, Mezar Kurin, and Canler. Vinchova reports that the Tow Rivers men are a problem, two are fourteen (THE PRICKLY BUSH THAT TAIM WAS TALKING AOBUT!) Donalo reports that Mishraile is receiving private lessons from Taim.. hmm. Welyn Kajima, Dedicated, runs up that Taim is back from Cairhien and posted new deserters, seven full Asha'man: Gedwyn, Torval, Rochaid, Kisman, Dashiva, Flinn, Hopwil, and Narishma. Logain tels Toveine and Gabrelle to go inside and he heads off with the Dedicated. Gabrelle says she's learned that all the full AM but Logain live in Taim's palace. Logain found Toveine's orders and burned them. One order was Elaida's to gentle and hang every man found. Gabrelle convices Toveine the captured AS must put their differences aside and stand united. Desandre and Lemai have the highest standing. Toveine agrees to submit. </p>
    
        <p><strong>Rand.</strong> WHOA! Let's go. Rand is in the City in Cairhien. People are working to clear rubble around the Sun Palace. Rand is back in the city at the Acadamy - this is awesome! Min, Dobraine, and Idrien are here. Rand can feel Alanna sulking. Min wanted to get some of Herid Fel's books. Dobraine tells Rand that some people think he is dead or kidnapped again. People think the attack was Forsaken or Aes Sedai. Dobraine tells Rand that Flinn, Narishma, and Hopwil are still in the Sun Palace. Ailil and Shalon have *disappeared* lol Rand trapped them under the beds. Rand told Dobraine that Cadsuane is probably holding them like she is holding Caraline Damodred and Darlin Sisnera. In the courtyard below, Mervin Poel's steamwagon beings moving under its own power and Rand is shocked! Idrien tells Rand about the other accomplishments at the school. Kin Tovere has finished his telescope, Maryl Harke has built a glider, Jander Parentakis has built a riverboat with waterwheels, Ryn Anhara has built a lightning jar, and there is mention of Niko Tokama. LTT mumbles to Rand and says "I thought I could build, I was wrong. We are not builders, not you, or I, or the other one. We are destroyers" WHAT?! WHO?! THE OTHER ONE?! HMMMM. Anyway, Rand has decided who will rule Cairhien and Tear, Rand gives Dobraine two packets - one for instructions for Dobraine as a steward for Cairhien. He also tells Dobraine to push for Elayne when she claims the Sun Throne. And he tells Dobraine to deliver the second packet when it is appropriate. Rand has a third packet in his pocket for Gregoin as steward of Illian. Dobraine and Idrien leave and Rand gets dizzy. He is used to them when channeling but this is the first time without saidin. Rand then opens a gateway to a clearing 500 miles away from Cairien, closer to TV. Yesterday Rand Traveled to Rhuidean where Rand asked about Shara, then Traveled to Tear and Rand asked about Chachin. He is trying to keep people off his real track. Rand has a bag with him that still has two ter'angreal (has to be those statues), but only Rand can use the male statue.. so maybe Nynaeve but that's difficult because he doesn't know where she is.. hmm. Then Rand tells Min that he plans to cleanse the taint on saidin! But first, he must kill Dashiva and the others...... WOW. I FEEL LIKE WE ARE SO CLOSE TO THIS!</p>

        <h2>Ch 1, Leaving the Prophet, Wolf</h2>
        <p><strong>Perrin.</strong> Perrin, Elyas, Grady, Aram, Seonid, Masuri and the two Wise Ones leave their meeting with Masema in his house in Abila. Colors swirl around in Perrin's head when he thinks of Rand... what is going on? That happens to Rand, but I don't think it is connected to when Rand is thinking of Perrin. But I'll have to go back to be sure. Perrin is furious with Masema insisting they travel by horse and not by Traveling. Masema has agreed to bring at least a hundred of his men. Neald and three Ward are there too. Balwer shows up and reports that King Ailron and the army of Amadicia were defeated by the Seanchan ten days ago at the town of Jeramel a hundred miles west. Valda and the Whitecloaks - the Seanchan lost a major battle and were driven back to ED. Perrin sees a hawk and thinks about Faile and how much he loves her... oh boy. He's about to get a rude awakening.</p>

        <h2>Ch 2, Taken, Wheel and Snake</h2>
        <p><strong>Perrin.</strong> Perrin rides Stayer as he and the others find the camp, and it's a mess! The Mayeners are in a standoff with the Ghealdanin. Berelain, Gallenne, and Annoura face Alliandre's First Captain Gerard Arganda. Berelain tells Perrin that Faile and Alliandre were captured by some Aiel. Perrin thinks this whole situation came from Rand's orders... yes, yes they did. Elyas and Berelain tell Perrin to remain calm. Elyas and Aram head southeast to scout. The three Warder follow. Grady and Neald keep watch and Balwer listens intently. Perrin calls to the wolves and finds Three Toes, Cold Water, Twilight, and Springhorn. There are a lot of two-legs around so the wolves can't help. They tell Perrin to give up and move on. Gerard Arganda threatens to put the Aiel with Perrin to question. Perrin goes OFF! Berelain tries to touch Perrin and he storms off with Gallenne. Perrin sees the four WOs who stayed behind. Gaul and the Maidens are there. Dannil Lewin tells Perrin he sent Jondyn Barran, Hu Marwin, and Get Ayliah to scout. Perrin asks Gaul to find Faile. Gaul LEADS SUILIN AND THE MAIDENS - that's awesome! Perrin realizes Bain and Chiad are with Faile. Perrin tells Grady and Neald to go get packed. Perrin asks Nevarin abou how the Aiel will treat Faile, she doens't know and tells Perrin to calm down. Perrin goes back to his tent and wonders where Masema is - also he thinks the WOs are plotting to kill Masema. Balwer has disappeared again. Basel Gill runs away from Perrin. Lini tells Perrin to take care of himself and confirms Maighdin is with Faile. Perrin promises to get them all back. Perrin and Tallanvor keep watch, they don't speak but they watch the moon rise together... aw lol</p> 

        <h2>Ch 3, Customs, HAWK</h2>
        <p><strong>Faile.</strong> I tell you what, this seems like this is giong to be a long drawn out process with these Shaido and Faile.. lol. Aiel and Faile. SO! The Shaido force Faile and the other captives to marhc through the snow naked. Rolan leads Faile. Faile is lifted up out of the snow and everyone else is - frost bite is the worst. Bain and Chiad will be gai'shain. Faile falls asleep and dreams of Perrin chasing her. She wakes up and a gai'shain gives her honey and tea. The gai'shain tells her she was shamed.. the Mera'din wrapped them in coats when they should have been left bare. Efalin should have known better. There are THOUSANDS of Shaido and Faile can't think of a way out..</p>

        <h2>Ch 4, Offers, Aiel</h2>
        <p><strong>Faile.</strong> This took a bit to get through. Small things kept happening, and I was expecting more really lol. So: Therava and Someryn arrive and dismiss Rolan and other Shaido. Someryn says they have more gai'shain for Sevanna. Alliandre announces who she is and that her liege lady is Faile. Sevanna is wearing wetlander clothes. Galina is here and says "yes" Alliandre is her. Faile knows Sevanna is responsible for Couladin and wants to hurt Sevanna for hurting Perrin. Sevanna' orders Galina to Heal the captives and Faile is amazed she is Aes Sedai. Sevanna announces that a fifth sept, the Jonine, has joined them. Therava says there are still 78 other septs. Clothes, food, and jewelry are given to this crew. Faile is seperated from Bain, Chiad, Lacile, and Arrela. There tells Faile and crew they will be gai'shain until they are old. Therava asks to spy on Sevanna. Galina comes and says "she's on an important mission from the WT." Faile tells Galina who she is and Sevanna has plans for Rand. Galina will keep her secret if they get a smooth white rod from Therava's tent, Faile desperately tries to think of a plan to escape. </p>

        <h2>Ch 5, Flags, Wolf</h2>
        <p><strong>Perrin.</strong> The Wolf Dream! We only know a little about this right? My assumption is this is TAR, but it's been some time since we've gottne some explanation. Perrin is a wolf in the Wolf Dream and is searching for Faile, Hopper confronts him and tells him he is in the dream too strongly and to leave or he will die. Faile is not there, Perrin tries to attack Hopper and then wakes up. Perrin wakes up in Berelain's tent without clothes. She tells him the missing people haven't been found and her scouts were dead. Galleene is trying to keep the camp secure, Arganda is sending out scouts despite her orders. Lini took Tallanvor back to his tent, but Perrin was nearly frozen. Annoura Healed Perrin, she said "he feltcold as though he had no soul", whatever that means. Perrin demands food and his clothes.. a few steps away from his bed. Perrin hopes Gaul or Jondyn find Faile. Berelain returns and offers Perrin a truce and Perrin doesn't understand and Berelain becomes angry. Berelain tells Perrin the Prophet has arrived with three or four hundred men - and she tells him Masema has been meeting with Seanchan. She also tells him her men were killed with crossbows and axes, not Aiel. Rosene enteres to bring food, but Berelain tells him that he would only be the third man to share her bed. Perrin leaves to find Masema. Masema's men are to the SW. Perrin notes the camps are packed and ready to move, Grady is by a fire. Perrin had planned to use the Wolfshead banner and Manetheren banner to disguise his mission but with so many of the Prophet's men that isn't possible.</p>

        <h2>Ch 6, The Scent of Madness, Falcon</h2>
        <p>Perrin. And just as I was down, I'M UP! This book is now picking up. I'm glad Masema and crew are coming with Perrin. THIS IS GOING TO BE BIG. There are SO MANY SHAIDO! Perrin is on Stepper, Perrin learns that Faile is alive from Sulin and Miadens and Warders. The Aiel are heading south Jondyn and Elyas are folling. There are arrows collected, half are Saido and the other half are from other clans. Sulin adds they saw Seanchan in the sky three times. Perrin feels he's caught in a blacksmith's puzzle.. ah that's cool! Perrin announces they will Travel forty miles to the south. He sends Neald to find Elyas and crew. Masema tells Perrin that all the Dragonsworn insisted on coming. Some think Perrin is Shadowspawn because of his eyes. I HADN'T THOUGHT ABOUT DARKFRIEND WOLF BROTHERS?! Perrin tells Masema to head east and that Perrin is going to find his wife, kidnapped by Aiel. Masema is surprised the rumors of Aiel are true and insists on coming along. He aggrees to Travel this one time and Perrin smells nothing but madness in him. Oh boy.</p>

        <h2>Ch 7, The Streets of Caemlyn, Lion</h2>
        <p><strong>Elayne.</strong> I am wanting more out of these Elayne perspectives lol. Elayne is going through the streets of Caemlyn on Fireheart (new horse) with Sareitha, her Warder Ned Yarman and eight Queen's Guards including Caseille, Deni, and Tzigan. Birgitte mainly recruits women. Elayne can feel Avi due to their new Sister-bond. Sareitha says the streets aren't safe. There are ten AS staying at The Silver Swan and they might be Elaida's - three more arrived and two left a few days ago. None are Red. Halwin Norry gave Elayne excellent info on the city, but Elayne wanted to go out for herself. Birgitte is coming and upset. They head back to the Palace and Birgitte meets them with news. While Naean and Elenia (who?).. (oh Andoran nobles) were being moved from Aringill to Caemlyn their guards were killed and they were freed. This means there is a spy in the Royal Palace. Reene Harfor intends to question every servent. Elayne thinks that if Jarid Sarand took them then House Arawn, Naean, will stand for House Sarand. Houses Anshar and Baryn will then join them. If Naean's people took them then Jarid will try to rescue Elenia. At the RP, Careane and one of her Warder Venr Kosaan are leaving. Sareitha and her Warder head to the library. Birgitte leaves then Elayne sends for Reene Harfor to meet her. yep.</p> 


        <h2>Ch 8, Sea Folk and Kin, A'dam</h2>
        <p><strong>Elayne.</strong> RJ, my guy, why did you have to name Reene and Reanne? Considering they're both named in this chapter with different interactions with Elayne?! Difficult to follow! So, Elayne wonders about spies. The First Maid outlines Elayne's schedule for the rest of the day including Halwin Norry about something urgent. He kept Caemlyn running since Rahvin took over. Some Kin are walking a sul'dam with an a'dam WHOA! The servants quarters are bursting with Kin and Sea Folk! Vandene comes up with Kirstian and Zarya (Kin - really old) who are now in novice white. Kirstian and Zarya have given suspects for Ispan's and Adeleas' murder… It should be none of their business. They reasoned out that it must have been Merilille, Sareitha or Careane. Elayne and Vandene are convinced that it was not one of the Kin. There are no Darkfriends among the Kin, else Ispan would have known much more about them than she did. I don't know that about the Kin. I imagine there might be a few Darkfriends among the THOUSANDS OF KIN?! DARKFRIENDS ARE EVERYWHERE!</p> 

        <p>Then Nynaeve and Lan show up, they're cute together. She has started wearing a ki'sain. Nynaeve has her hands full with the Kin, even with Alise helping, and now the Windfinders want lessons from her. Nynaeve pressures Vandene into taking charge of Kirstian and Zarya. Vandene acquiesces, but she says she only taught novices a short time because the Mistress of Novices, Sereille Bagand, thought she was too harsh! WHOA! </p>

        <p>Nynaeve then takes Elayne to Reanne. Nynaeve has sent eighteen of the Kin into Seanchan held territory to find and rescue any of the Kin there. They do not see how Egwene will realize her plan of incorporating the Kin into the White Tower. They find Reanne with Alise Tenjile and one of the sul'dam, Marli. Rand sent twenty-nine captured sul'dam and five damane. Alise says the sul'dam nearly have the spark to channel. Elayne intends to convince the sul'dam that they can channel, then send them back to the Seanchan. She hopes this will break the Seanchan power structure.</p>

        <p>Reanne says that three of the five damane, Marille, Jillari, Alivia, Kara and Lemore, are ready to be let out of their collars. Marille and Jillari still believe they must be collared, but Alivia says she hates sul'dam. She was collared when she was thirteen or fourteen and is now over four hundred years old. She is also stronger than Nynaeve. The other two who are ready are Kara who was a village wise woman on Toman Head and Lemore who was a Tanchico noble. They agree that the last three must be freed of their collars. </p>

        <p>A lot happened this chapter. WHOA!! </p>

        <h2>Ch 9, A Cup of Tea, Forsnaken</h2>
        <p><strong>Elayne.</strong> Well hello forkroot tea, you do be minty. Alright let's go! Elayne is in her rooms with her maid Essande to help her change out of her riding clothes. Elayne is going to go meet with merchants with Birgitte. She can sense Birgitte is frusted with her paperwork. Halwin Norry (First Clerk) is waiting for her in her sitting room and reports that there are large deposits of alum(inum) being discovered on her estates at Danabar. That will make the bankers more amenable to lending money even though Danabar is some distance from the Lugard Road. Elayne is delighted. She wants to fund the Academy of the Rose - Rand started another school in Caemlyn and Elayne has taken it over in memory of Morgase. Norry tells her about Elaida's proclamation regarding Rand. It was Alviarin.. um actually Elayne. Norry also tells Elayne about the Sun Palace attack from the OP - a week ago and Rand disappeared. The Blight is unusally quiet and the rulers of the Borderlands seem to be unavailable (PROLOGUE TPOD!!) King Roedran is raising an army in Lugard, Elayne knows this from Egwene. Norry tells her she has support from the ST in Cairhien. She tells him to write letters to the major Houses as she is stating her claim on the ST as daughter of Taringail Damodred, she will claim it when things are settled in Caemlyn. Norry leaves and three *maids* bring her lunch then Dyelin comes in with news of an army in Braem Wood. A reliable Illianer merchant named Tormon brought the news from New Braem. There are thousands of Arafellin, Kandori, and Shienarans - Elayne things they must be there because of Rand - they want to attack Rand!! As Elayne drinks her... forkroot tea, she feels woozy and realizes it is forkroot. She tries to send a feeling of panic to Birgitte and tells Dyelin she's been poisoned. Three servants come in and draw knives. Dyelin screams murder and attacks them and one man slashes Dyelin. As Elayne is passing out, Elayne sees two of the men are now dead and the third is struggling with an axe-faced guardsman who came to her rescue. I'm trying to remember but is this axe-face the man.. let me read.. brb..... Daved Hanlon? That's no good.</p>

        <h2>Ch 10, A Plan Succeeds, TAR</h2>
        <p><strong>Elayne.</strong> Well that wasn't much worry now was it? Elayne is awake and safe all thanks to someone named Doilin Mellar a Guardsman. Avi, Birgitte, and Nynaeve are with her and it's night, Nynaeve Healed Dyelin. Nynaeve gave Elayne herbs to overcome the forkroot. Elayne thinks Dyelin proved her loyalty. Avi isn't around as much because Melaine and WOs have her back in training. Birgitte shows Elayne a knife they recovered - Nynaeve said it had deadly poison on it. They think it was a complicated plan and Elayne agrees to having some bodyguards with Mellar at the head. He fought for Morgase during the Succsession. Elayne drinks a glass of wine and goes to sleep to enter TAR with Nynaeve. They're in the Grand Hall of the RP, Nynaeve using the twisted ring is misty. Eg tells about the days events. The Sitters don't want to accept new novices because there are only 16 Accepted to train them. Eg wants Nynaeve to meet Sharina Melloy (NYNAEVE'S ACCEPTED TEST!) Eg now intends to keep using the Oath Rod and require the Three Oaths, Nynaeve and El disagree. The eldest of the Kin, Aloisia Nemosni is nearly 600 years old! She might die if she swears, but Eg is adamant. She spells out her plan for the Kin, they keep their ways but are tied to the WT and subservient to the Amyrlin. All sisters must swear on the OR. But if they want to retire they can and may be released from their oaths and join the Kin.. woo! But they must give up their title as AS. Nynaeve asks about Eg's headaches and she says Halima is good at massages lol. THEN they see a man standing by the door.... LORD LUC / SLAYER?! A man that looks like he could be Rand's Uncle! He runs away, they hear a door clicking shut at the opposite end of the room. El tells Eg about the Borderlands, Eg is irritated they must be after Rand, El is pleased and now knows how to use them to secure the Lion Throne! WHOA! COULD IT BE LUC??</p>

        <p><strong>Asne.</strong> Whoa! Asne and Chesmal (WORLD'S BEST HEALER besides Nynaeve..) are in Caemlyn. Asne avoids conversation with Chesmal beacuse she's annoying - she is bragging about questioning Tamra and how she told the Reds to murder Sierin Vayu. Names... Eldrith returns and Chesmal is angry she is late. Eldrith is in charge though, on Mogi's orders. They all remained in Samara even after the Prophet moved into Amadicia, then they fled Eldrith's Warder Kennit after he tried to hill her. They decided on Caemlyn in hopes that Elayne and Nyaeve would come there. Temaile enters wearing a glass bracelet ter'angreal. Eldrith is annoyed. They agreed not to visit TAR because they think Ny bested Mogi there. Temaile reports Ny and El are in the RP. They call them wilders and they think there are only three AS in the RP. She adds there are others spying on the two Accepted, a man they saw and someone else (this is in TAR)... I THINK IS SLAYER!! the other person they couldn't see... I DON'T KNOW! Asne thinks to herself that she is glad her for Warder are nearing Caemlyn, she stopped masking herself when they left Samara. Powl is the only Darkfriend among them... A DARKFRIEND WARDER! That makes sense, you don't have to be anyone special to be a Warder. And then Temaile still has the balefire fluted black rod from Mogi. Whoa!</p>

        <p><strong>Mili Skane.</strong> OH NOO! So I was right baout Murellin being Daved Hanlon, woo! Mili Skane now thinks of herself as Lady Shiaine Avarhin - with a beautiful told backstory by RJ.. wow. The Heart and Hand is the sigil of the House Avarhin. Falion serves are her maid, satifying Moridin's punishment. Shiaine thinks her failure is buried.. On Moridin's orders through Mogi, Marillin also reports to Shiaine. Marillin tells Shiaine she can't do what she wants. There are too many channelers in the RP, however there is a woman in the RP who can do what Shiaine wants. Shiaine thinks that must mean BA! Then Hanlon enters announcing himself the Captain of the Queen's Bodyguard. uh oh. </p>

        <h2>Ch 11, Ideas of Importance, Sea Folk (what a cool tattoo idea btw)</h2>
        <p><strong>Rand.</strong> Rand opens a gateway in an attic in the RP.. I CAN'T WAIT FOR THIS MEETING! Min is there. Saidin makes Rand sick and LTT begs him to let go. Min has a sneezing attack from the dust. Rand is disguised using the Mask of Mirrors. Min wants Rand to see El and Avi but he refuses. Rand wants to find Nynaeve and Mat, then leave. They go down the stairs and run into Reene Harfor, Min tells her that "Nuli" has somethign for Nynaeve and it must be delivered immediately. They are surprised to learn that Mat isn't there. When Rand thinks of Mat he gets colors blurring his mind and thinks he sees Mat's face... interesting. Rand can tell there are lots of women channling even though the First Maid tells him there are only five AS there. Rand wonders about the rumors of hundreds of AS heading to Caemlyn with an army. </p>

        <p><strong>Nynaeve.</strong> I'm pumped! Nynaeve is giving a lesson to Talaan while Zaida and six Windfinders look on. ... Talaan eventually shields Nynaeve and Nynaeve tries to break it (finding a soft spot) but can't. Nynaeve runs into Alivia (seanchan) who says Reanne Corly wants Nynaeve to join her for dinner. Talaan catches up with her and asks to go to the WT to train. Lan and Nynaeve go to her room - Rand is there and gives Nynaeve the woman statue ter'angreal for the sa'angreal! Also, Nynaeve tried to Delve Rand and stepped back after she felt a ward of saidin. Rand wants to cleanse saidin and Nynaeve is excited! Nynaeve agrees but only if she and Lan go with Rand now! I'M SO EXCITED. I still love Nynaeve and want her to be happy. That is all - reading on!</p>

        <h2>Ch 12, A Lily in Winter, Dragon</h2>
        <p><strong>Elayne.</strong> Elayne, Min, Avi, and Rand love each other and Rand has now been bonded by the three - INCREDIBLE! Beautifully written and described.. wow. Min is with Avi and Elayne and Elayne's bodyguards, they enter Nynaeve's room and Rand is there. They all profess their love for each other and Nynaeve is not having it lol. Rand tells them not to trust any Asha'man except Flinn, Narishma, and Hopwil - I am inclined to believe Rand here. Rand also apologizes for the sul'dam and damane. Rand still thinks Mat is with Eg but they don't tell him otherwise. Rand wants to leave immediately but they all convice him to stay... ;). Rand disguises himself as Nuli and goes to Elayne's room - they ask to bond him as Warder. He tells them about Alanna and Elayne says that doesn't ward him against being bonded to more than one AS. He agrees and Elayne and Avi link and weave Spirit around the three women and lay the weave on Rand. All Three women can now feel Rand's pain and his love. Rand goes to leave but Elayne says there is just.. one more thing. Min and Avi leave and Elayne asks Rand to help take her dress off..... bow-chicki-wow-wow... hahahaha this is awesome. </p>

        <p><strong>Min.</strong> I love a good Min viewing. Also, I have absolutely no idea what is going to happen to all of these people being bonded together. I literally have zero idea what to expect and I love that. After eight WOT books, its hard not to see some things coming and that's why I love the unexpected. This: unexpected. Let's talk about some Viewings! Min sees that Elayne will have children from this experience with Rand a boy and a girl - healthy and strong, so will Avi - FOUR! Something was odd about having four children at once, healthy but odd. Min and Avi see Birgitte, and Min recognizes her as Birgitte Silverbow from Falme! Min can't get block the feeling of Rand out of her head, Avi can, Birgitte can't either (right? I read that right, Birg can't block it?) - then they all get drunk.</p>

        <p><strong>Elayne.</strong> Rand you sly dog - into the next morning too ;) lol. Elayne wakes up to find Rand gone and he left her a present of a golden lily in full bloom (in the winter Rand... how??) Elayne weaves a Keeping around it and it will stay fresh forever. Mogi taught her that. As the Joker says... and.. here.. we.. go... Alivia, Nynaeve, and Lan left in the night. The Kin, Zaida, and the Windfinders are in a tizzy. The most perful angreal and some ter'angreal from the ED stash have been taken. Whoa!</p>

        <h2>Ch 13, Wonderful News, Cairhien Sun</h2>
        <p><strong>Cadsuane.</strong> I'm really interested in what Cadsuane's got going on - she is a force! Cadsuane is in the SP with Harin and her Sailmistress Derah and they are meeting with her demanding the return of Shalon. Cadsuane is annoyed with the Sea Folk. A lot of people are there - Daigian, Eben, Nesuane, Sarene, Erian, Beldeine, Elza, Verin, and Sorilea. Verin has her flower brooch (angreal, right?) and Sorilea gives Verin a vial and tells her it will help her sleep but not too much because it can kill! Cadsuane shuts down Harine and tells Sarene to take the SF back to their rooms. Sorilea reporst 19 prisoners, Chisaine, Nurbaya, Janine, Innina, and Vayelle swore to Rand last night. Cadsuane is sus. Cadsuane once tried to root out the BA (failed!). She also failed about learning about Moiraine and Siuan. oh Moiraine we miss you (SHE WILL BE BACK!). Sorilea goes to the fireplace to lecture the four sisters there. Verin tells Cadsuane that Bera and Kiruna got nowhere questioning Shalon and Ailil, so Verin gave it a try. They were just covering up the fact that they were pillow friends which would cause both of them great embarrassment. Cadsuane tells Verin to let them go, but to have Ailil report on Toram Riatin and Shalon report on the Sea Folk. Cadsuane has already blackmailed the three Asha'man. Corele enters and says Damer Flinn Healed Irgain!! A MAN HEALING A WOMAN STILLED?! WOW! Do we trust Flinn, we have to right? Rand does. Flinn wants to try to Heal Ronaille and Sashalle - Rand stilled them. Irgain is ready to swear to Rand. Cadsuane began gathering sisters she trusted as soon as she heard about the strange events in Shienar - she also had e-a-e watching Siuan and Moiraine for YEARS! More... Jahar comes in and says Alanna is uncoscious. Corele, Sorilea, and Verin follow. Dobraine comes up and says Caraline and Darlin left Arilyn's place on their way to Tear where Darlin will be Rand's steward. No Healing works as she's not hurt but Alanna is just scared and Verrin looks terrified. They wait.</p> 

        <p><strong>Demandred.</strong> WHO IS CYNDANE?! I know (my guess is) Moridin is Ishamael, Rj basically told us this chapter.. he thinks he's the DO himself. ISHAMAEL! I can't wait for that reveal. SO: Demandred is meeting with Graendal, Osan'gar, and Aran'gar - nice, glad the transmigration is out there. Semirhage has a hard time getting to the meetings (she's in shayol ghul right?), and they wonder why Mesaana is missing (she's in the WT). Dem has a thought abuot view-walls, shocklances, and sho-wings no longer being made outside this place near Shayol Ghul - that would be a vacuole right? Dem is furious that Rand is no where to be found even though he's been seen everywhere and the attempt on Rand's life was filed. Osan frowns when Dem calls the failure Asha'man fools and idiots... OH OSAN'GAR ARE YOU AN ASHA'MAN?! Aran'gar says that Osan'gar and Demandred are responsible for wathcing Rand... is DANI RIGHT ABOUT DEMANDRED BEING TAIM?! WOW! that's not confirmed just seems like it. Aran' says her charge is under control.. cough, Egwene. Graendal says Aran' and the men should be worried if Rand succeeds - Osan' thinks Rand can't possible remove the taint. Graendal says that if Rand succeeds the DO won't trust those who channel saidin... oh that's interesting! Dem notes she is wearing a simple gold ring. During the War of the Shadow more than a dozen of the Chosen died because of the DO's suscpicion. </p>

        <p>Moridin comes in with Cyndane and says the DO knows they are all loyal. Moridin comments that Isam is still supposed to find and kill Fain - I've completely forgotten about Isam!! He was the one who sent the Trollocs to the Two Rivers, or at least that's what the Trollocs shouted "ISAM!". Moridin vaporizes the rat with the True POWER.. nice. He is Nae'blis and only Moridin has access to the True Power. Cyndane announces Rand has two of the "access keys" and intends to use the Choedan Kal. Dem thinks Graendal's reaction is fake - Dem thinks Cyndane is Lanfear until Mesaana told him she was weaker than Lanfear. Moridin says theywill all know when Rand starts to use the Choedan Kal, he orders them to take him or kill him if neccessary. This is going to be good!</p> 


        <h2>Ch 14, What a Veil Hides, Seanchan</h2>
        <p><strong>Tuon.</strong> THE DAUGHTER OF THE NINE MOONS!! BOOM! MIC DROP! Oh wow, this chapter brings into perspective just how BIG this story is. Wow. I love this so much! This was an incredible introduction to this character we've heard so little about... so goooooood! AHHHHH!</p>

        <p>Alright - Tuon is in her cabin in the Victory of Kidron. Selucia, Tuon's so'jhin and chief maid, shaves her head then dresses her. In secret, Selucia is also a trained fighter and her bodyguiard. Tuon keeps eyes on omens, first is an albatross, an omen of victory. Omens are the same whether in Imfaral or Noren M'Shar (wherever that is). Selucia was a cradle-gift for Tuon. Tuon wishes she were more impressive, two of her siblings are dead and two more disgraced and made da'covale. Anath is Tuon's Soe'feia or Truthspeaker. Her previous, Neferi, died in a fall two years ago. For some reason, the Empress named Anath instead of Neferi's planned successor. OH BOY IS THE EMPRESS A DARKFRIEND?!?! DARKFRIENDS EVERYWHERE! </p>

        <p>Tuon asks for a veil instead of her lace cap. This marks her as just one of the Blood and not the Daughter of the Nine Moons - she decides on the veil because she feels bad for ordering a damane beaten last night after they told the future... Tuon almost feels sei'mosiev and must make amends to restore sei'taer. Tuon goes to the second cabin where six of her damane and their sul'dam await. She tells Ianelle to give treats to Lidya, the damane she had beaten. She ordered Lidya to toell her futture and didn't like what she heard. The other damane are Dali, Dani, Charral, Sera, and Mylen (AS). Tuon bought her at Shon Kifar and trained her herself, she was especially difficult and nearly died. Catrona neow holds her leash. Tuon leaves her cabins and Musenge, captain of the Deathwatch Guards, notes her veil and assigns only two guards. Deathwatch Guard armor is lacquered blood read and nearly black green. There are a dozen Ogier GARDENERS STANDING GUARD! Yuril, her secretary bows, he is also her Hand and in charge of her Seekers - Ronde Macura prostrates herself (I love that word). In Tanchico she begged to be taken into service and provides lots of info on AS she hates. </p>

        <p>Tuon goes to the quaterdeck where Captain Tehan and Anath are. Anath chides Tuon for wearing the veil over a little thing like a beating. She continues berating Tuon. Tuon recalls that Algwyn, the last man to sit on the Crystal Throne almost a thousand years ago, let his Soe'feia get away with slapping him in public. Tuon tells ANath that she doesn't need a penance. Anath's last penance left Tuon crying for days. Tuon says that Suroth is to be commended for her success but to be watched for her ambition. Anath says she is sure Suroth is loyal... DARKFRIEND! I TELL YA! Tuon says they must make contact with Rand so that he can kneel before the CT before The LB according to the Prophecies of the Dragon. Anath is pleased and tells Tuon to be careful not to let him learn how dangerous she is to him. They approach the harbor of ED!</p>
