        <h2>When I Started Reading</h2>
        <p>I'm really happy to be back reading the Wheel of Time. Make sure to check out my <a href="../../html/reviews/franchise/wheel-of-time-in-review.html">Wheel of Time in Review</a>!</p>

        <p>I am currently reading, as of June 19, 2023, so this is going to be a review in progress! And below, I'm going to have notes as I read, by chapter. More than likely spoilers, so I'm going to keep those hidden by the box below. When I've finished my read, the Notes box will be moved below the spoiler box, probably past the score!</p>

        <h2>Written Review</h2>
        <p>Book Seven had a lot of expectations to reach, after the ending of Book Six - Lord of Chaos. I felt this fell a little flat for me. I read this in two weeks, and that was good. I didn't feel this was a SLOG, but I my socks weren't blown off. A good Wheel of Time book for sure!</p>

        <p>The more I think about this book.. I really liked it, but it hasn't been my favorite Wheel of Time book. Still a 4 out of 5 for me. Not a 5 out of 5 like the others! Hopefully A Path of Daggers gets a higher score.</p>

            <p>And here we are. Six books in and we keep building! Robert Jordan has outdone himself, these characters are so incredibly deep. The world is vast and the named characters are getting extravagant.</p>

            <p>This book is a bit violent and dark. I’m so excited to continue this series! 9 more books to go!</p> 
                
            <p>This is my favorite book in the series so far. There is a lot of story left, many story threads left open and there is a building of a villain coming back and so much more.</p>
                
            <p>This, I believe is the longest book in the series, at 1,015 pages. It took me over a month to read, a lot of family things happening in that time, so it didn’t feel very long.</p>

    <p>There is a particular aspect to spoilers that I prefer to make known to you.</p> 
    <p>If you don't want to see the spoilers, you won't see them. There is a clear break when spoilers begin and they are typically separated by a <strong style="color:red;">RED</strong> box with the words "Spoilers".</p>

        <h2>Spoilers</h2>
        <p>Just a bit of preamble here.. the way this review will be is a lot of different from others. I'm wrote notes on every single chapter that I read. Which is completely spoiler, so this is where the spoilers start.. read at your own risk!</p>
    
        <p>And now I'm adding in predictions for upcoming books and more! Check that out below.</p>

<!-- spoilers -->
    <!-- <details id="spoilers">
        <summary>Spoilers</summary>

        <h2>Spoiler Review</h2>
        <p>This book, I wanted to love. I didn’t love it as much I did Lord of Chaos. This book didn’t really do much in terms of plot, it really setup for the next books I’m guessing. But I felt this book fell flat. I was expecting a lot, that was probably my fault. </p>

        <h2>Timeline</h2>
        <p>This book also only took place over 10 days, which really makes you put into perspective that not much happened this book. That might be while I’m so hung up. I wanted so much more from this and I feel like only a few things happened. </p>

        <h2>Rand</h2>
        <p>I’m really interested to see what happens next! The start, Rand comes back after Dumai’s Wells and he is in a bad place after all those deaths because of him, he didn’t kill them himself, but he helped form the Asha’man and a bunch of people came to his rescue to kill A LOT OF SHAIDO. That’s a lot for Rand, and this book we see a bit of the aftermath of that in Rand’s mood. Rand also has sex with Min, that was an odd scene because Rand and Min just learned of Herid Fell’s death and emotions were running in strange directions. But they did. An old Aes Sedai, Cadsuane, comes in and Rand is having trouble with her.</p>

        <h2>Perrin</h2>
        <p>We got Rand banishing Perrin with a bunch of people including Faile and Berelain, and some Two Rivers men - to get Masema and bring him to Rand. Masema is a lot crazy, so I can’t even imagine what is going to happen next with that. Before that, Perrin spent a lot of time trying to make up with Faile. They did… wink. </p>

        <h2>Mat</h2>
        <p>Mat was very ta’veren this book. Also, there was some horrible things that happened to Mat. He was sexually assaulted by a Queen. He thought she would stop, but she didn’t. Now Mat has to live with that forever. </p>

        <h2>Nynaeve</h2>
        <p>I still love Nynaeve. This book, she acted a like a very stubborn human would, in how she treated Mat. </p>

        <h2>Aviendha</h2>
        <p>Oh, Aviendha didn’t do much this book. She was just kind of here. She tasted sea water and didn’t like it. Anything else?</p>

        <h2>Dragonmount Summary</h2>
        <p>If you'd like to read a summary, read the <a href="https://dragonmount.com/Books/Crown_of_Swords/summary/" target="_blank">Dragonmount Summary</a>.</p>

        <summary style="background-color: rgb(27, 105, 57);">Predictions and Theories</summary>
        <h2 style="font-style:italic;">Predictions</h2>
        <p>Let's see how I do, when I check back here after a few books.</p>

        <h2>From Lord of Choas</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Who is the lord of chaos, We still don't know.</li>
            <li>Where is Logain, We didn't see Logain at all this book.</li>
            <li>The cloud bowl, will it work? We got the bowl in the second to last chapter, haven't used it yet.</li>
            <li>Moiraine, Still dead, might be a part of some prophecies.</li>
            <li>Lan, Made it to Myrelle,then Egwene opened a Gateway for Lan to get to Ebou Dar.. then he got to Ebou Dar and saved Nynaeve from drowning and then Nynaeve was able to break her block by surrendering. Then Lan and Nynaeve got married!</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>What's Next?</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mat's Dice, Okay, so Mat ending this book with a building falling on top of him as the Seanchan invaded Ebou Dar. I have no idea what the Dice are really for, and I want to know what is going on. Also, I don't believe Mat dead.. can't be!</li>
            <li>Alanna's Bond, We keep getting little bits of this, but I'm really interested in this. I want to know if Rand will be able to break this or not.</li>
            <li>Moiraine is Not Dead, From the Fires of Heaven, I still think Moiraine is not dead. Neither is Lanfear. We don't know much about where they are - in that doorway ter'angreal. No way they're dead! I'm excited to learn more about them.</li>
            <li>LTT in Rand's Head, The end of this book didn't have much about this, I'm still interested!</li>
            <li>The Watcher, Moirdin, I THINK THIS IS ISHAMAEL! We haven't gotten any confirmation, but I THINK IT'S ISHAMAEL. I'm so excited about this prediction. Because.. (this is from chapter 20) The Watcher. Okay, I'm going to rant a bit here. THIS IS ISHAMAEL! YES YES YES! Oh, i'm so excited about this prediction. This is Ishamael. He's back! Using the **True Power** holy cow!! WOW. Okay, first off, I was wrong, the two Caddar and Maisia was Sammael and Graendal. ANyway, this is Ishamael, for sure. I am excited to learn more about this True Power, the one that Lanfear and.. someone I can't remember was trying to get/use in the Rhuidean visions. Wow. Okay, so this True Power comes straight from the Great Lord and the Watcher... Ishamael, sees black flecks in his vision. Gosh I'm just so excited about this prediction. Mesaan ahad a hand in kidnapping Rand. Graendal won't risk teaching the Wise Ones Compulsion unless Sammael has found a binder.. nice! The Watcher, Ishamael, is covered in fancloth except for his eyes so he can't be seen. Graendal hates the name Maisia. Sammael opens a Gateway, and eventually Graendal follows. The Watcher feels the prickling of saidar end and smiles crookedly. He decides not to kill the eight women. AND RIPS A HOLE IN THE PATTERN WITH THE TRUE POWER AND STEPS OUTSIDE THE PATTERN. HO-LY CRAP! Ishamael. Ishamael. Also more and more predictions. Ishamael will be Nae'blis. Ishamael is the Lord of Chaos. Ishamael. YES YES YES!<br><br>Why do I think that? Honestly, I think this only because we've gotten Osan'gar and Aran'gar come back, so now we know that Forsaken can come back. But this True Power thing has me feeling Ishamael. It was a feeling I got with how knowledgable the Water seemed with the world and Sammi and Graendi. And how excited he was to use the True Power. And his skin prickled when Graendi channeled. And this person is clearly from AOL and at least super knowledgeable with saidin and the Pattern to be able to step outside. And I am just begging for Ishi to come back.. lol</li>
            <li>Egwene and Aes Sedai Fealty, Egwene has several Aes Sedai swear featly directly to Egwene and that hasn't happened EVER BEFORE. I'm excited to find out what are the ramifications for this.</li> 
            <li>Cadsuane, She is probably not a Darkfriend, but she is fiesty. She isn't going to be good for Rand or Asha'man.</li>
            <li>Seanchan, THEY'RE BACK! Oh this is going to be crazy, I'm so excited about this.</li>

        <h2>Prologue, Deceptive Appearances, Wheel and Snake</h2>
        <p><strong>Ethenielle.</strong> First off, is this going to be all Seanchan book?! A lot of Seanchan notes as the first sayings.. sweet! THIS IS GOING TO BE CRAZY! RJ is showing off here. All these new names are just crazy lol. Going to be a lot of fun to try and remember these names. Okay, Ethenielle, queen of Kandor.. according to the map and the words on the pages - we are close to the Blight in the Borderlands! The King of Arafel, Paitar Nachiman. The King of Shienar, Easar Togita. AGELMAR! The Blight has been quiet lately.. uh oh. Don't speak too soon. Tenobia Kazadi, Queen of Saldaea. </p>

        <p>I started writing this because.. when Tenobia comes, there is a mention to Tenobia not being married and if she were to die the right would go to Davram or to Davram's heir... oh oh! FAILE! Is that possible?! Could Faile get Saldaea, which would mean Perrin and Faile would have Saldaea? Whoa! That's cool! Prediction: Tenobia = dead, Davram = dead, Faile Queen of Saldaea! No idea how or when.. just that's the prediction.. okay READING ON!</p>

        <p>This is a cool ceremony of the blood oath! However, We've got thirteen Aes Sedai and they're close. Now, after this blood oath they are going to *find Rand and "do what needed to be done, whatever the price"*... oh no.</p>

        <p><strong>Verin.</strong> Verin! Okay.. so Verin is a sneaky Aes Sedai, but for the Light! So that's good lol. Verin is using some Compulsion but not Compulsion. She is giving orders to the Aes Sedai that kidnapped Rand, at least the ones that are still here under Wise One watch. Katerine escaped last night.. oh no! Verin is in the Aiel camp near Cairhien. The captured Aes Sedai are da'tsang. Verin has a plan of her own. It's been seventy-one years since Verin's last serious mistake. some Wise Ones know how to Link now. Verin knows Cadsuane, vaguely. Rand's ta'veren caused Verin to swear fealty. Verin has an angreal! small flower brooch. Verin learned this Compulsion from wilders who've come to the White Tower. Verin also, and we've known this.. I think, has a notebook where she writes a cipher of notes down and one day she wants to write out what each picture / icon means. She did drop the notebook and a Wise One picked it up but didn't understand the pictues. WOW! GO VERIN! Verin won't use Compulsion on a man because it works poorly on them. Verin grew up in Far Medding and would've married Eadwin, but she went to the White Tower. Verin thinks she has to keep Rand alive until it's time for him to die. Whoa. </p>

        <p><strong>Moridin.</strong> I am sticking to my guns, Moridin is Ishamael. I will hold out that hope. Okay, Moridin is in a room with no doors or windows studying a game of sha'rah. Sha'rah, tcheran, and no'ri (now known as stones) were played in the Age of Legends. He wears two mindtraps (we saw that last book - one is Mogi). A servant comes with lank eyes to bring him wine.. Blank eyes.. Ishamael did this at the Darkfriend social. Oh RJ.. just tell me already! The key piece in sha'rah is the Fisher a man with a blindfold and a wounded side. "only nine people living even remembered the game". So much to think about here.. wow. Recollection of a disaster brings him to fury and Moridin seizes the True Power nearly crushing the mindtraps and the Fisher piece. Moridin is playing both sides of the board and is thinking about Rand al'Thor!! OH OH!</p>

        <h2>Ch 1, To Keep the Bargain, Sea Folk</h2>
        <p><strong>Aviendha.</strong> I tell you what, I'm anxious! I'm on edge! The Seanchan are there y'all! Why aren't they attacking these Aes Sedai? Anyway, THE WIND PASSES TEMALKING!!!! WE ARE GOING TO GET SOME USE OF THOSE GIANT STATUES! This is neat, the Amayar people who follow the Water Way. They have their own prophecy of the giant statue. The wind passes over the Sea of Sorms to Altara. Seafaring folk use the wind and currents to travel from World's End to Mayene and beyond. WHOA! COOL! Okay, so Aviendha is ready to leave Ebou Dar.. me too girl. Aviendha feels watched. Teslyn is there and the girls warn her about Moghedien, the gholam, the Black Ajah, and the coming storm. Teslyn doesn't believe them. It's the day after the Festival of Birds, the day of the Feast of Embers, there will be fireworks by an Illuminator, woo! There will be traveling shows as well... VALAN LUCA! Okay, this crew goes to the palace stableyard where twenty Sea Folk, five Aes Sedai, five Warders, and eleven Kin. Ispan is there, drugged, shielded and guarded. Avi opens a gateway - she has trouble and thinks its like a mirage in Termool, what? Elayne taught her the gateway because she can't remember hwo she did it before. Aviendha feels watched again and spots a man watching from the top of a spire! She tells a Windfinder to warn Elayne and Nynaeve. Here we go.</p>

        <h2>Ch 2, Unweaving, Forsnaken</h2>
        <p><strong>Elayne.</strong> Oh wow cool, Elayne senses where Birgitte went (warder sense, not the right name I'm sure), the Careane + Cieryl, and Nynaeve is looking the direction Lan went.. but it was his track that Nynaeve saw! WHAT A GOOD CALL BACK! So, first off - will we ever use this Bowl?? Anyways a circle of thirteen need to run the Bowl. In addition to Traveling, linking is one of the skills the Aes Sedai will teach the Windfinders. Rainyn (Windfinder) is as strong as Romanda and the apprentice Metarra is as strong as Elayne and another apprentice Talaan is as strong as Nynaeve.. WHOA! STRONG. Elayne is looking through a panier bag and finds a blue stone root-like carving, a small ivory box with red and green stripes, a stiff flexible black rod, a tiny vial of red liquid, a two foot statue of jolly bearded man holding a book. Nynaeve says the rod feels like pain. Elayne finds an angreal, an amber turtle brooch. It's not too strong, but it will give her twice the strength of Nynaeve! STRONG. Can Elayne learn to make angreal too?? MY GUESS = YES! Vandene warns about the danger of ter'angreal, twenty five years ago Martine Janata burned herself out studying ter'angreal for forty years. Aviendha begins to unweave the gateway.. and everyone is shocked! Aviendha tells them it is the only way not to leave residue that can be analyzed or recreated. Aiel Wise Ones are trained in unweaveing. Aviendha can read residues as much as two days later - a very rare Talen. Nice! MORE PERSPECTIVES!</p>

        <p><strong>Moridin.</strong> WHOA! Moridin is pumped to see what Aviendha did.. unravelling the weave. WHOA! I am a sucker for RJ's writing. "Ripped a hole in the Pattern to Travel". Ugh, amazing. Okay, the man Aviendha saw was Moridin (Ishamael - my prediction). He ponders the new things that weren't known in AOL - Healing severing, involuntary Linking, Warder bonds, unweaving, and the strength of the Windfinders in weather control. A palace servant Madic tells Moridin the treasure if from AOL, Shiota and Eharon. Miridin never heard of the Bowl of the Winds before and now he is concerned they may fix the weather. Then he accidentally kills Madic. Moridin wants to stop them from using the Bowl or make them pay. </p>

        <p><strong>Gholam.</strong> Oh sweet a gholam POV! Okay, this gholam has never been hurt before. It also feels an itch with the power being used but doesn't know it as the True Power... oh oh! Is Rand going to use the True Power to destroy all the gholams? That'd be neat! I wonder if the gholam has something to do with the taint? Probs not. If the taint is gone, are gholams still around? probably. Anyways the gholam has faded memories. It can feel both the gateway in the stablewayrd and the other one miles northeast. It was commanded to kill Mat and the women. It is following the women because they are an easier target. It lives on fresh blood, Madic is warm fresh blood for it. It is going to follow the women.</p>

        <h2>Ch 3, A Pleasant Ride, Wheel and Snake</h2>
        <p><strong>Elayne.</strong> I am grinding my teeth. WE ARE DRAGGING. This whole chapter people talked, Adeleas somehow had flies ignore her, Aviendha was upset because Kurin didn't deliver her warning. Eventually we arrive at the farm. Let's use the Bowl of the Winds. This seems like such padding, this chapter. Wait.. they past the statue of a Shiotan Warrior Queen, barefoot statue. Is that the other statue for the sa'angreal Rand has?? Okay, maybe I'm jumping to conclusions here, and I just need to read and enjoy and read and find out. I recant my statment.. lol. This book is taking it's time.</p>

        <h2>Ch 4, A Quiet Place, Darkfriend Women</h2>
        <p><strong>Elayne.</strong> We're at the Kin farm. We meet Alise. There are only women at the farm, the Kin don't marry. Panic ensues because these are Aes Sedai. Windfinders are saddle sore. Garenia is there, who? Elayne wonders about ageleessness. Vandene and Adeleas question Ispan - she claims Elaida sent her. Elayne want question Ispan, Tower law is too restrictive. V and A keep on. Elayne finds more ter'angreal. She andAviendhafind the following - ajewelry setmeant to be worn together, a dull dagger with a gold wrapped horn hilt, lots more jewelry, statuettes of birds and animals and people, more knives, a thick red rod which feels warm, a set of metal balls and a glass blacksmith's puzzle. Aviendha handles the dull dagger and seems curiously affected by it. There are also two more angreal - a gold bracelet and rings, stronger than the amber turtle, and an ivory statuette of seated woman, weaker than amber turtle. Keeping that for later.. and Nynaeve Heals the Sea Folk riding bruises and she says "it's time" to use the Bowl lol. Let's see.</p> 


        <h2>Ch 5, The Breaking Storm, Lion</h2>
        <p><strong>Elayne.</strong> THE BOWL HAS BEEN USED! I was way wrong. And now I am certainly excited! This is what I was waiting for. I was waiting
        for the Seanchan to show up. A lot about linking, this is super cool but… Caire leads and activates the Bowl using all five Powers. The Bowl starts drawing even more saidar and also draws saidin! A huge column of both rises into the air.
        IT HAS STARTED!! SO SO COOL! Okay, so here we go. So no one is going back to Mat or Olver, ahh. Yes yes yes! The Bowl has been used! Elayne gives the seated woman angreal to Aviendha, the bracelet and rings to Nynaeve and the amber turtle to Talaan. Thirteen women will form a circle around the Bowl - Talaan din Gelyn, Metarra din Junalle, Rainyn, Naime, Rysael,Tebreille din Gelyn South Wind,Caire din Gelyn Running Wave, Nynaeve, Elayne, Aviendha, Reanne, Kirstian and Garenia. Caire, who has studied Bowl lore, leads the circle. Nynaeve and Elayne teach the Windfinders how to link. The process of Linking is described in detail. Sareitha has studied Linking extensively. She implies that she and a few other sisters know how to bring men
        into a circle! SEANCHAN!</p>

    <h2>My Thoughts</h2>
    <p>Oh no, I struggled a bit with this book. Something that is holding this book up.. the prose and world building! Other than that.. not the best I've read so far. I tell you what, I am struggling with numbers. Does anyone care about numbers? Do you care if I like the book? Most of my reviews are 5/5 anyway, I love almost everything that I read or watch, so let’s talk categories.</p>

    <h2>Emotional Impact</h2>
    <p>This book was an easy read, but I just wasn't as impacted emotionally to this book. It was good, some good things happened, but it is hard to come close to Rand in the box or Dumai's Wells. </p>

    <h2>Characters</h2>
    <p>Nothing really stands out to me about any characters in particular. But, I will say - I'm pretty interested in a few characters. Cadsuane, an old Green Ajah Aes Sedai who won't stand down. The Watcher.. who I think is Ishamael back! The Asha'man, I'm so interested in learning more about them. Rand went through a lot this book, not as much as the last book, but he has a lot on his plate. I love Lan, I'm interested in his story with Nynaeve now. My love for Nynaeve went down a bit this book, but I'm still interested in her story. Mat, always a winner for me, was raped this book. And that was hard to read. He kept trying to brush it off, but he is hurting.</p> 

    <h2>Plot</h2>
    <p>Hmm. Seanchan have started to invade, we got that near the end. We've got the Bowl of the Winds. Nynaeve and Lan are married and Nynaeve has broken her block! Rand and Min made love. Fain sliced Rand with the Ruby Dagger. Rand now is the King of Illian. I really don't know if Rand killed Sammael. There is a new power.. the True Power from the Dark One. Mat was raped. Elaida is looking for Black Ajah in the Tower. More people learned how to Travel. We have a Knitting Circle, an incredible number of rogue Aes Sedai Wise Women, over 1700! And Aes Sedai are really old! We meet one who is over 400 years old! Also, Loial is going to all the steddings and the Waygates.</p>

    <h2>Prose</h2>
    <p>Always a pleasure to read RJ's writing. Perfect. </p>

    <h2>World Building</h2>
    <p>BIG BIG BIG building here! TRUE POWER! A new power that is used by the Chosen who were chosen by the Dark One! Oh and a gholam is here! Seanchan are invading! HERE WE GO!</p>
