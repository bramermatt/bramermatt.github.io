        <blockquote>The Silmarillion by J.R.R. Tolkien | Book Cover</blockquote>

        <h1>The Silmarillion by J.R.R. Tolkien | Book Review</h1>
        <p><em>March 20, 2024</em></p>

        

        <h2>Written Review</h2>
        <p><em>Started reading 3.14.24.</em></p>

        <p>This is dense. This is not a true "narrative", this is a history of Middle Earth and how the world was created, who created it and their offspring. And then the coming of the races from them. This is so difficult to communicate, but this is beautiful. Utterly spectacular writing. </p>
        
        <p>The more you read this book, the more awesome it gets! My goodness, there are chapters in this book that are some of the best writings of J.R.R. Tolkien. HOLY SMOKES! </p>
        
        <p>You have to read this, well you don't, but if you want to learn more about Middle-Earth... I might say you don't need to read this, but wow, is this beautiful. That's what I'll say. It is beautifully written. It is a literal history of Middle-Earth. Not an easy flowing narrative, but amazing.</p>
        
        <p>Here is a chapter title: Of the Beginning of Days. Yes, the literal beginning of the numbering of days in Middle-Earth are recounted here. HOW STINKING AWESOME IS THAT?! Oh, is it understandable... not entirely, but come on! How cool?? I can't believe I'm able to read this, it is an amazing experience reading this. </p>
        
        <p>Does everyone need to read this? No, not really. There are hints of what you see in The Lord of the Rings, and that's neat. I am really searching hard for a narrative, but if I back off and just enjoy what I'm learning, because that's what this is: a book to learn from. I wouldn't say you won't enjoy this. Gosh, I'm doing a poor job selling this story. </p>
        
        <p>Okay, this is the First Age of Middle-Earth, the creation of the world and an account of the Elder Days. What you've heard bits and pieces of, you'll get a clearer picture of here. In this story, and this is from the back of the book cover: three Silmarils, jewels that held within them the Light of the Two Trees of Valinor, and Feanor, the most gifted of elven artificers. When the Two Trees are destroye, the Silmarils become coveted, setting into motion events that lead to the rebelion of Feanor and his kindred against the gods, their exile from Valinor, and their hopeless war against the greatest enemy Middle-Earth has ever known: Morgoth. </p>
        
        <p>There is also A LONG TIME between pages or chapters. AGES long. INCREDIBLE! Oh, but do I love this story? YES HECK YES! Oh this is good stuff here! There is so much in this book, my goodness. I love this so much.</p>
        
        <p>There is SO MUCH IN THIS BOOK. WOW. I'm bewildered and befuddled about the words on these pages. Wow. This is really awesome!</p>
