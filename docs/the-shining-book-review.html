<h3>Part One: Pratory Matters</h3>

<p>
Ch 1: Job Interview
Oh this is a lot of... fun. I've not read anything but fantasy lately and whoa - this is very exciting to start for me at least. I'm excited to see where we go from here. I've never read horror before, and I've never seen this movie either. HERE WE GO! 

Jack Torance is offered the job of winter groundskeeper at the Overlook Hotel. Ullman speaks again and asks if Jack’s wife, Wendy, really knows what she is getting into. Jack assures Ullman that both Wendy and their son, five-year-old Danny, are both incredible people and will be just fine.  Ullman asks Jack to step around the desk and look at the hotel floor plans. The top floor is the attic, Ullman says, and is all storage. Jack is to set rat traps in the attic, and under no circumstances, Ullman adds, should Jack allow Danny in the attic. Jack says he won’t, and wonders what kind of father Ullman thinks he is. The Overlook Hotel has 110 rooms total. There are 30 suites on the third floor—one of which is the Presidential Suite—and each has a beautiful view of the mountains. Both the first and second floors have 40 rooms, doubles and singles, and each floor has three linen closets and a storeroom.

The Overlook Hotel has consistently lost money since it opened, but this last season, under Ullman’s supervision, it turned a profit for the first time in 70 years. Part of the reason why the hotel loses money, Ullman says, is the harshness of winter. To remedy this, Ullman has started hiring a winter caretaker to fix problems as they arise and heat alternating floors of the hotel. However, Ullman tells Jack, the first winter he’d hired a winter caretaker, a “horrible tragedy” occurred.

The first winter caretaker, Ullman tells Jack, was a man named Grady, and he was a total drunk. Jack interrupts Ullman and tells him that he no longer drinks. Ullman nods. Al Shockley has already told Ullman that Jack is sober, but Al also told him how Jack lost his last job as an English teacher at a Vermont prep school because he’d “lost [his] temper.” When Ullman hired Grady during the winter of 1970-71, he was hesitant. Grady had a wife and two daughters, and spending the winter at the Overlook means being cut off from the outside world for months.

Ullman confirms that the hotel bar has been cleaned out, and then he tells Jack that he is going to send him to talk to Watson in the basement. Before Ullman shows Jack out of his office, he says that he hopes there aren’t any “hard feelings.” Ullman knows he is tough, but he only wants what is best for the Overlook. Jack smiles, but is happy when Ullman doesn’t try to shake his hand. There are plenty of “hard feelings,” Jack thinks to himself. 

That is an incredible amount of info just in chapter one. I am excited to read on! 

Ch 2: Boulder
Wow, this is impecibly written. This is such an interesting story. These characters.. wow. They're real. 

Wendy looks out the window of the Torrances’ Boulder, Colorado apartment. Danny is sitting in the street below, waiting for Jack to return in the family’s rundown old Volkswagen. Wendy silently curses Jack and his pride. Al Shockley had offered a pay advance, but Jack refused. She hates the Boulder apartment compared to their small but nice house in Stovington. The Boulder apartment is old and dirty, and they must listen to the man in the next apartment beat his wife. None of it, Wendy thinks, is good for Danny.

Feeling an immense sense of grief, Wendy goes outside and sits next to Danny on the curb. “What’s up, doc?” she asks. Jack won’t be back until dinner, she reminds Danny. It is a long drive up the mountain. Danny asks Wendy if she thinks the VW will break down, and she says no, although she secretly isn’t convinced. Danny then asks why Jack lost his job back in Stovington. Wendy explains that Jack was the school’s debate coach, and that after he cut a student, George Hatfield, from the team, George got angry and slashed the tires on Jack’s VW. Wendy stops, and Danny asks if Jack hurt George Hatfield the same way he hurt Danny.

Wendy tells Danny that Jack hit George to make him stop cutting the tires, and the school said they didn’t want him to be a teacher there anymore. She changes the subject and asks Danny if he wants some milk and cookies. Danny says he would rather wait outside, since Jack might return home early. As Wendy goes inside, Danny asks her if she wants to go live at the hotel. Wendy says she does, if that is what Jack wants, and she asks Danny if he wants to live there. Danny supposes he does. Plus, there isn’t anyone to play with in Boulder anyway. Wendy feels a pang of guilt for taking Danny away from his friends and goes inside. In the kitchen, she puts out a plate of Oreos, then goes to bed and cries.

Ch 3: Watson
Whoa, we get the story of how Jack "lost his temper". Breaking Danny's arm when he was three. Really makes me think, as a dad, that I should slow down when I'm angry. We learn about the the boiler, the plumbing, and the deaths at the Overlook. 

As Watson talks about the furnace, Ullman’s words run through Jack’s mind. “You lost your temper,” he’d said. Watson moves on to the boiler, and Jack follows, but his mind is on Danny. It had happened so fast, but it had seemed like an eternity. Jack’s papers—most importantly the manuscript of his play—had been strewn about the study, and spilled beer was foaming everywhere. Danny, at three years old, stood grinning in the middle of the mess, and Jack lost it. He grabbed Danny’s arm, spun him around to spank him, and heard the sickening snap of Danny’s bone and his son’s instant screams. Jack was immediately remorseful, but when Wendy saw Danny’s arm hanging at an extreme angle, Jack knew that she hated him.

As Watson’s voice cuts through Jack’s thoughts, Jack runs his hand over his lips. He is badly craving a drink and wonders if this feeling will ever leave him. Watson is pointing at the boiler’s pressure gauge, which measures in pounds per square inch. The boiler is old, Watson says, and doesn’t have an automatic shut off. Jack will want to keep the gauge at 50 or 60 to alternately heat the wings of the hotel—the west wing one day, and then the central wing, followed by the east wing—like Ullman wants. “I hate that little fucker,” Watson says of Ullman. “Yap-yap-yap, all the livelong day.”

The boiler is rated to 250 psi, Watson tells Jack, but Watson wouldn’t stand next to it at 180. As Watson moves on to the plumbing, Jack looks at the mounds of cardboard boxes and papers stacked in the basement. There are layers of records, invoices, and receipts, and Jack thinks the Overlook’s entire history is rotting in the old boxes. The plumbing freezes occasionally, Watson continues, but if Jack hits the frozen portion of pipe with direct heat and runs the faucets, he should be fine. Jack interrupts Watson and asks about Grady, the first winter caretaker.

Watson nods. Grady was a bad guy, he says. A ranger from the National Park found them. Grady stashed the bodies of his wife and daughters in the west wing to freeze before he shot himself. Ullman came back from Florida, where he runs a resort during the off-season, and managed to keep the murder-suicide mostly out of the papers. There wasn’t much that could be done about the obituaries, Watson says, but that wasn’t bad considering the hotel’s reputation and history of scandals. Jack’s interest is piqued.

All big hotels have scandals, Watson tells Jack, and ghosts, too. Lots of people come and go in hotels, and some of those people die of heart attacks or strokes. Plus, hotels are superstitious. They don’t have a 13th floor or room 13, and they don’t hang mirrors on the backs of doors. In fact, Watson says, a woman named Mrs. Massey, died in the hotel just this past July. She was at least 60 years old and shacked up with a kid who wasn’t more than 17. One night, the kid came to the desk and said that his “wife” was “indisposed”—which meant she was drunk—and he was going into town. He left in Mrs. Massey’s Porsche and never came back.

Indeed, Watson tells Jack, about 40 or 50 people have died in the hotel since Watson's grandfather built it in 1910, but Watson has never seen a ghost. Watson directs Jack toward the stairs. He will show him the equipment shed next. The shingles are in the shed, Watson says, and Ullman wants Jack to reshingle the west roof before the snow falls. Watson goes on about Ullman, warning Jack how cheap Ullman is and that he will weasel free work out of Jack, but Jack is thinking about Grady, stuck in the snow and slowly going insane. Jack wonders if Grady’s family screamed when he killed them. As Jack follows Watson up the stairs, he thinks that he could use a drink—or 1,000 drinks. 

Ch 4: Shadowland
Well dang if that wasn't crazy! Also, of course I have been spoiled on the REDRUM is MURDER, but I don't really know what that means, so I'm interested to see what that plays out to be. This was crazy. Pretty neat though, to read. Interesting that Danny can concentrate and "read" thoughts. Also Tony, his "friend". INTERESTING! 

Danny sits outside on the curb. He knows by the growing shadows that it is almost five o’clock, even though he can’t tell time yet. He thinks about Jack and Wendy—he understands a lot about his parents, but they often refuse to believe it. Soon, Danny thinks, they will have to believe. It is a shame that Wendy doesn’t believe him now, as she lays in bed crying. Danny knows that she worries about grown-up things that he doesn’t quite grasp, but right now she is worried that the car has broken down or that Jack is doing the “Bad Thing.” Danny knows that neither is true. Jack is nearly home now.

Danny knows all about the “Bad Thing.” A boy at his school in Vermont had a father who did the “Bad Thing,” and his parents got a “DIVORCE.” Danny can see the word in red letters in his mind. He knows all about “DIVORCE,” too: it is when you don’t see your daddy, except on weekends. To Danny, “DIVORCE” is the absolute worst thing in the world, and he can sense the word circling in his parents’ minds. Danny first learned about “DIVORCE” after Jack hurt his arm. He hardly remembers the accident, but he clearly remembers his parents’ thoughts of “DIVORCE.”

He hardly remembers the accident, but he clearly remembers his parents’ thoughts of “DIVORCE.”

Sometimes when Danny concentrates, Tony will come to him, but not always. Tony has only appeared twice since moving to Boulder, and the most recent time was to show Danny a missing trunk under the basement stairs. The trunk contained the manuscript of Jack’s play, which Jack was worried the movers left it in Stovington. Danny told Jack that the trunk was under the stairs, and Jack was instantly angry that Danny was in the basement. The basement, Jack said, is dangerous and off-limits. Danny insisted that he didn’t go into the basement and that Tony had told him. Jack and Wendy shared a confused look. The basement was always locked.

Danny sits on the curb, imagining Jack’s voice and concentrating on Jack’s thoughts. Danny can hear Jack thinking about shingles and a guy named Watson. Suddenly, Danny hears Tony calling his name. He can see Tony from the corner of his eye, far down the street. Danny settles in on the curb and lets his mind wander down the street, in the direction of Tony’s voice. There is deep snow everywhere, and a huge building with lots of windows and a shingled roof. The shingles on a portion of the roof look much newer than the others, and Danny instantly understands that Jack had laid the new shingles. A skull and crossbones flashes into Danny’s mind. “Poison,” Tony says from somewhere in the darkness.

Several signs flash into Danny’s mind (but he can’t read them), which say “DANGER!” and “KEEP OUT!” The signs fade and Danny is in a strange room he doesn’t recognize. Snow is piled up outside the windows and there is a mirror that has “REDRUM” written on it in green fire. The room fades and another room appears. Here, the window is broken, and the furniture is overturned. Danny can hear crashing sounds and a familiar voice yelling, “Come out! Come out, you little shit! Take your medicine!”

The room again fades, and Danny is a hallway in which the carpet is bright blue with black twisting shapes crossing every which way. “REDRUM,” he thinks again and hears the booming voice: “Come on and take your medicine! Take it like a man!” A dark shape advances on Danny, “reeking of that sweet-sour odor,” swinging a huge mallet. Danny can hear the mallet cutting and hissing through the air, and he begs Tony to take him back. Suddenly, Danny is sitting back on the curb.

On the curb, Danny can just make out Tony’s figure in the distance. “Be careful, doc…” Tony says as he fades away. Just then, the Volkswagen comes sputtering down the street, and Jack parks at the curb. Danny runs to him, excited, but stops when he sees a mallet on the front seat, one end clotted with blood and hair. Danny blinks and the mallet is a bag of groceries instead. Jack lifts Danny and hugs him. Wendy comes outside to greet Jack and kisses him, and the three of them go inside together. For the moment, Danny is happy. He knows there is love in his family, and he is glad his father is finally home. Not everything Tony shows Danny comes true, and for now, things are alright. Still, a cold fear settles in Danny’s heart as he thinks about “REDRUM.” He has absolutely no idea what it means.

Ch 5: Phonebooth
Wow. This is something special. So Danny dreams about Jack.

Jack pulls the Volkswagen up to the drugstore and tells Danny to wait in the car. He just has to make a phone call. They have a phone at home—Wendy insisted on it since Danny is prone to “fainting spells”—but Jack wants privacy. He is calling Al to thank him for the job, and he would rather not do it in front of Wendy. Jack’s pride is all that he has left. In the drugstore, Jack goes to the phone booth and looks out the window at Danny. Jack feels his love for Danny rise up inside of him, but Jack’s face remains emotionless. 

Six months ago, life had not been so tough. Jack’s job at Stovington Preparatory Academy paid well, and Torrances even had a small savings account. Then, Jack “lost his temper” with George Hatfield. Jack remembers when Al told him that the Board of Directors at Stovington wanted his resignation. Jack gave it to them, but he knew that had it not been for George Hatfield, he would have gotten tenure instead. He remembers badly wanting to get drunk so badly afterward—he’d wanted “to take it out on Wendy and Danny,” his temper “like a vicious animal on a frayed leash.” 

Jack picks up the phone. For a handful of quarters, the operator will connect Jack with Al, who is 2,000 miles away, for three minutes. “Time is relative, baby,” Jack says to himself and drops in the quarters. Al’s father was a steel baron, and when he died, he left Al a huge fortune and several seats on various boards. One of them was at Stovington Prep, and upon taking this seat, Al immediately became friends with Jack. They were always the drunkest people in the room, so they just sort of gravitated to each other.

At the time, Al and his wife were separated, and Jack and Wendy’s marriage was falling apart, too. Jack would often stay out drinking until dawn and come home to find Wendy sleeping on the couch with Danny. Jack hated himself, and he often thought of “the gun or the rope or the razor blade.” Still, Jack didn’t believe he was an alcoholic, even though he knew Wendy cried in the bathroom and his colleagues gave him “cautious looks” at parties and functions where alcohol was served. They were all talking about him, and Jack knew it, but he still didn’t think of himself as an alcoholic.

Al finally picks up the phone. Jack tells him that he just called to say thank you. He got the job at the Overlook and will be heading there soon. Al commends Jack on staying sober through the George Hatfield ordeal and promises that the Board at Stovington will come around by spring. Some of them already think they were too hasty in demanding Jack’s resignation, Al says. Jack thanks him again and hangs up. In the car, Danny begins to tell Jack about the vision he had while waiting for Jack to get back from the Overlook. But Jack is distracted and, Danny knows, thinking about the “Bad Thing.” Danny is disappointed. “I dreamed that you hurt me, Daddy,” Danny thinks to himself.

Ch 6: Night Thoughts
This is amazing writing man. WOW. I believe this "caul" is important.. those born with a caul (a thin membrane covering the face or eyes) are said to have "second sight". 

In bed next to a sleeping Jack, Wendy thinks back to all the beds they have shared. They’d gotten together in college—Jack studied English, Wendy studied sociology—not long after Wendy’s mother kicked her out and told her not to come back. She said that if Wendy needed any help, she should just go to her father, since it was Wendy’s fault they got divorced anyway. That was in 1970, and she remembers that first bed most clearly. With Jack’s help, Wendy finally gave up on her mother. “She wants to keep beating you,” Jack said.

Early in Wendy and Jack’s relationship, Jack insisted they separate for a while. Wendy thought he was seeing someone else, but he wasn’t, and the breakup didn’t last long. When Jack came back, he knew that Wendy had been to see her father. She asked Jack how he could possibly know that, and Jack replied: “The Shadow knows.” They were married not long after. Wendy’s father came to the wedding; her mother did not. After Danny was born, Wendy reconciled with her mother—for Danny’s sake—but their relationship has always been strained, and Wendy’s mother is forever judging her and thinks that she is a poor mother to Danny. 

When Danny was born, a caul covered his face. Wendy keeps the caul in jar, but she refuses to give into the caul’s superstition. Those born with a caul (a thin membrane covering the face or eyes) are said to have “second sight,” but Wendy doesn’t believe that. Still, Danny seems to know things, and he did say that Jack had an accident. After the night Danny had the dream about the accident, Jack changed. Even Al said nothing happened that night, but Wendy knew he was lying. She kept a close eye on the papers and waited for the police to show up, but nothing happened. 

In her sleep, Wendy does believe that Danny has “second sight,” and that she is “permanently welded” to Danny and Jack. In her sleep, Wendy believes that “their three/oneness” is so strong, that it can only be destroyed by an outside force, never one of them. Through all of their problems, Wendy never stopped loving Jack, except for when he broke Danny’s arm. More than anything, Wendy loves the three of them together, and this is her final thought as she drifts to sleep.

Ch 7: In Another Bedroom
Well this is very interesting lol. I don't truly know what is going on. But I'm interested to know what's going on. 

As Wendy drifts to sleep, Danny wakes up in his own bed. He can still hear the words of the mallet-wielding figure from his dream. “Come out here and take your medicine! I’ll find you! I’ll find you!” With his heart pounding, Danny goes to the window and looks out, calling for Tony. Danny looks up and down the street, but Tony is nowhere to found. Suddenly, Danny can hear Tony calling his name. “Don’t go, Danny…” Tony’s voice says from the darkness of the street below. Danny stands staring out the window—for a minute? Or an hour? He doesn’t know. Then, Danny goes back to bed. He closes his eyes, and as he falls asleep, the word “REDRUM” flashes in red in his mind.

<h3>Part Two: Closing Day</h3>

Ch 8: A View of the Overlook
REDRUM WAS HERE! We're going to the Overlook now! 

As the Torrances’ old Volkswagen putts up Sidewinder Pass on the way to the Overlook Hotel, Wendy reads the road signs to Danny. They pass signs warning danger and falling rocks, and as they climb higher into the Rocky Mountains, Wendy eyes the rock cliffs nervously. The mountains are beautiful but unforgiving, and Wendy can’t help but think about the Donner Party. She asks Jack again if the hotel’s larder is fully stocked, and he says it is. When they arrive, they are supposed to meet up with Hallorann, the hotel’s cook, for a tour of the kitchen and pantries.

Climbing the mountain, the car begins to choke and sputter, so Jack parks to let it rest for a moment. They get out of the car and can see the Overlook in the distance. Wendy is struck by how beautiful it is, and she yells to Danny to look, but he has a fallen into a daze with his eyes clouded over. Jack shakes him and asks if he is alright, and Danny’s eyes clear immediately. He was thinking, he tells his parents, and didn’t mean to scare them. Back in the car, Danny knows that the Overlook is the building from his visions. It is the place with all the snow and the figure stalking him with a mallet. In a moment of absolute fright, Danny knows that “Redrum,” whatever it is, is at the Overlook Hotel. 

Ch 9: Checking it Out
Dude, this is cool. I love that Danny can see? is that what we're calling it? "see" what people are thinking? 

Danny tries to pretend that he isn’t scared. Tony’s visions don’t always come true, Danny reminds himself. He vows to be careful. He will be on the lookout for anything that could be “Redrum.” For now, Jack and Wendy are happy, and Danny doesn’t want to jeopardize that happiness. Danny sees a sign he doesn’t recognize and asks Jack what “ROQUE” spells. Jack tells him that it is pronounced “roke,” and it is a game similar to croquet. Danny asks if roque is played with a mallet, and Jack says it is, except roque mallets are shorter and have one rubber end and one wood end. Near the roque court, Wendy points out a group of animal topiaries—a dog, a rabbit, a horse, a cow, and three lions—which are situated near a playground that will be all Danny’s. Danny tries to sound enthusiastic about this.

As Danny looks at the surrounding mountains, he suddenly feels very alone. He doesn’t yet know the word “isolation,” but he would immediately understand if it was explained to him now. His family will be the only people left in the hotel, and once it begins to snow, the road down to Sidewinder will be impassable until the spring thaw. Danny watches as an older woman walks through the lobby to her car outside, which has been brought to the door by a young and attractive hotel employee. As the young man helps the woman with her luggage, Danny enters her thoughts. “I’d like to get into his pants,” the woman thinks. Danny is confused and can’t imagine why she would want to wear the man’s pants.  

Ch 10: Hallorann
Holy smokes, is Dick Hallorann TONY?! He knew Danny's nickname... and Danny knew his first name! I DON'T KNOW BUT I LOVE THIS READING ON!

As Danny looks at the surrounding mountains, he suddenly feels very alone. He doesn’t yet know the word “isolation,” but he would immediately understand if it was explained to him now. His family will be the only people left in the hotel, and once it begins to snow, the road down to Sidewinder will be impassable until the spring thaw. Danny watches as an older woman walks through the lobby to her car outside, which has been brought to the door by a young and attractive hotel employee. As the young man helps the woman with her luggage, Danny enters her thoughts. “I’d like to get into his pants,” the woman thinks. Danny is confused and can’t imagine why she would want to wear the man’s pants.  

As Hallorann shows Jack, Wendy, and Danny around the kitchen, Wendy sees that it is indeed stocked. There are dry and canned goods, and plenty of frozen meat, including a turkey for Thanksgiving and a capon for Christmas. They can get milk and fresh bread in Sidewinder until the snow falls, but after that there is plenty of powdered milk. There is more than enough food to see them through the winter, but Wendy can’t stop thinking about the Donner Party. Hallorann says there is even a leg of lamb in the freezer somewhere, and he asks Danny if he likes lamb, calling him “doc.”

Jack asks Hallorann how he knows they call Danny “doc.” They didn’t tell him this, and no one has used the nickname around Hallorann. Hallorann laughs and says Danny looks like a “doc,” and then he flashes a wide smile at Danny. Danny hears Hallorann’s voice say in his mind, asking “Sure you don’t want to come to Florida, doc?” Wendy senses something pass between her son and the cook, and Hallorann leads them out of the kitchen, where they walk past a bar called the Colorado Lounge. Hallorann tells Jack that if he is a drinking man, he better have brought his own alcohol, since the bar has been picked clean. Jack tells Hallorann that he doesn’t drink just as they arrive in the lobby. Hallorann’s luggage is waiting by the door, and he asks Danny to help him take the bags to the car.

Ch 11: The Shining
This is what I'm excited for, I want to learn more about the Shining. THIS IS GREAT! So Danny is the strongest "shine" Hallorann has ever seen. MORE GIVE ME MORE! 

After Hallorann and Danny load Hallorann’s luggage into the trunk, Hallorann invites Danny to sit in the car with him, though he worries momentarily that someone will think he is trying to kidnap the boy. In the car, Hallorann tells Danny that he has the strongest “shine” he has ever seen, and Hallorann will be 60 this winter. Hallorann can shine as well, at least that is what his grandmother called it, and she had the “shining,” too. Hallorann asks Danny if he has been lonely thinking he was the only one, and Danny nods. There are others, Hallorann says—lots of people shine and don’t even know it. “Give me a blast,” Hallorann tells Danny. “Think at me.” Danny concentrates and sends a message: “!!! HI, DICK!!!” Hallorann immediately recoils, stunned by Danny’s strength.

Danny hesitates, and finally asks Hallorann if he can do anything else besides enter thoughts. Sometimes, Hallorann says, there are dreams. Danny says that he sometimes dreams, too, only he is awake when this happens. Tony brings the dreams, Danny explains. Wendy and Jack call Tony his “imaginary friend,” and when Tony comes, Danny kind of passes out and sees things. Hallorann explains what Danny has is called “shinin on.” Some call it visions or precognition, but it is really just seeing the future. When Hallorann shines, he smells oranges, but the dreams and feelings he perceives don’t always come true. 

Hallorann tells Danny that he has worked at the Overlook for two seasons now, and he has had some bad dreams and seen some bad things. There was even a maid, Delores Vickery, who saw something in room 217. She could shine, Hallorann says, but she didn’t know it. He tells Danny that something bad happened in room 217, and that Danny should never go in there. Many bad things have happened in the hotel, and people who can shine will see them, but the visions can’t hurt Danny. Hallorann says the visions are like pictures, and Danny shouldn’t be afraid.

Hallorann asks Danny if his parents can shine, and Danny says he doesn’t think so. Hallorann tells Danny that he’d tried to send Wendy a thought, and that she’d jumped a little bit. All mothers can shine, Hallorann explains. Hallorann had tried to send Jack a thought, too, but Jack’s mind was blocked, as if he was hiding something. Hallorann doesn’t bother telling Danny this and instead says he doesn’t think Jack can shine at all.

Danny becomes aware of Wendy’s thoughts. She is starting to wonder what he is doing in the car and wants him to come back. He tells Hallorann that he must go, and Hallorann tells Danny that if he ever needs help, he should send him thoughts in Florida. Danny’s shine is so strong, Hallorann knows he will hear it. As Danny walks away, he is still frightened. Hallorann doesn’t think anything at the hotel can hurt Danny.

Ch 12: The Grand Tour
Quite the tour. Seems like Danny's visions are becoming realities. 

Danny comes back to the lobby and Wendy asks him what he was talking about in the car with Hallorann. Danny shrugs, and Wendy can see Jack in the gesture. Danny and Jack are so close—both in likeness and their relationship—that Wendy often feels like an “outsider.” Wendy realizes with shame that she is jealous of Jack’s relationship with Danny, and she is horrified that she is beginning to act like her mother. Ullman approaches the Torrances and offers a quick tour of the hotel. As they walk across the lobby to the elevator, they pass Watson, who gives Wendy a wink and a “lecherous” smile that makes her uncomfortable. 

They get on the antique elevator and Danny looks nervous. Ullman tells him not to worry. The elevator was installed in 1926 and has been running without issue ever since. Wendy isn’t consoled, and she imagines them, alone in the hotel, stuck between floors in the ancient elevator. She thinks again of the Donner Party and makes a mental note to stop obsessing. The elevator climbs to the third floor, and when they step out, Danny is frozen with fright. The carpet is the same bright blue and black carpet from his vision.

Ullman leads them out of the Presidential Suite and back to the elevator. As Danny looks over his shoulder on the way out, he sees that the blood stains are back, and notices that he has bitten his lip hard enough to draw blood. Ullman then shows the Torrances to the second floor and walks right by room 217 without stopping. He explains to Jack that all the windows in the hotel must be shuttered. Danny stares at the old-fashioned fire extinguisher and hose affixed to the wall, disturbed by the object without knowing why. The hose of the extinguisher is coiled and has a brass nozzle at one end. Ullman directs them to the first floor to their living quarters. Hallorann lives in the room during the season, and while there isn’t a kitchen, they should be very comfortable. Wendy agrees that the room is more than adequate, and they leave to walk Ullman out. 

Back in the lobby, the Torrances pass Watson, who is also preparing to leave. He reminds Jack to keep a close eye on the boiler and gives Wendy another lustful look. As Ullman picks up his bags to leave, he reminds Watson to be back by May 12th. Watson nods, and Danny catches Watson’s thoughts. Watson really hates Mr. Ullman, Danny thinks. As Watson and Ullman walk out to their cars, Danny feels as alone as he has ever felt in his life.

Ch 13: The Front Porch
But will we be here May 12? WHOA! WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN?! Fire hose..

Jack, Wendy, and Danny stand on the porch of the Overlook Hotel as Ullman and the last of the employees drive away. They watch the cars disappear in the distance, and Jack realizes they are completely alone. He has a “curious shrinking feeling,” as if his “life force” is growing smaller and the hotel is growing larger. He looks around the grounds and thinks the hotel seems to have grown and “become sinister, dwarfing them with sullen, inanimate power.” Jack looks down at Danny. Danny’s nose is “running like a fire hose,” Jack says, and Danny and Wendy inside.
