<h2 id="july-4">July 4</h2>
<p>July 4 was a busy night for mattbramer.com. And that's no exaggeration. I hadn't planned on blasting 4 hours of work in 1 hour. I did a lot of updates tonight and that was mostly on the fly thinking, so things may be broken. I'll have to do some tests tomorrow, it's 0:06 as I'm writing this update.. yes I use 24 hour time, I've got to write about that soon!</p>

<h2 id="blogs">Blogs</h2>

<p>A major update came to blogs recently.. there are more blogs! I've been working hard on what is considered <em>Content Creation</em>. Most web developers, like myself now.. that's cool to say, but we have to really be content creators if we want to run with the crowd. So, that's what I'm trying. I'm writing a lot and I'm working on making things better all the time!</p>

<h2 id="tags">Tags</h2>
<img src="../../img/updates/third/currently.png" alt="tags">
<p>So, you might've seen these "#'s", and i'm calling those tags. They are considered a lot of different things to a lot of people. Hash tags, topics, pound signs. I'm calling them tags, because it's short and simple. Eventually I'm going to have hover and dropdown tags in the navigation bar for each "tag / topic".</p>

<p>A tag is just a collection of a topic. So, for the image above, you'll see #currently. From there you can see the collection that falls under #currently: Currently Listening, Reading, and Playing. So that's what you'll see all over the site now. I have tags all over the review section.</p>

<p>That is mostly to keep things tidy, but for future proofing as well. As I continue to improve the site, things like tags are needed.</p>

<h2 id="final-note">Final Note</h2>
<p>I wrote a blog called "Who Cares, Really?", check it out: <a href="../../docs/blogs/random/who-cares-really.html">Who Cares, Really Blog</a>. I am absolutely not asking for pity with this post. I was really serious with this.</p>

<p>I agree with everything that I said. And with that said, I couldn't be happier with the site in it's current iteration. There are a lot of things that I have future plans for, but that is for the future. I just want to thank you checking out the site as much as you have!</p>

<p>Be sure to continue to check back on the site to see any new improvements or new posts!</p>
