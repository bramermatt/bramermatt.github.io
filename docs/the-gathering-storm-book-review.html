        <h2>Header</h2>
    <p>"Ravens and crows. Rats. Mists and clouds. Insects and corruption. Strange events and odd occurrences. The ordinary twisted and strange. Wonders! The dead are beginning to walk, and some see them. Others do not, but more and more, we all fear the night. These have been our days. They rain upon us beneath a dead sky, crushing us with their fury, until as one we beg: "Let it begin!" —Journal of the Unknown Scholar, entry for The Feast of Freia, 1000 NE"</p>

    <h2>Prologue, What the Storm Means, Wheel and Snake</h2>
    <p><strong>Renald Fanwar.</strong> Oh heck, this is why I love the Wheel of Time. A character we've never heard of before has an entire backstory that can be told in a few pages and we know what they're dealing with but they aren't exactly sure what's going on... so good! Renald Fanwar is a Borderlander farmer, seeing unnatural black and silver clouds come and go. His friend Gaffin thinks he's crazy. Thulin, a close blacksmith from Oak Water comes by in a loaded wagon with his wife Gallanha and daughter Mirala. They left everything behind and are "heading north". An army will be gathering and they need a smith. Renald's farmhands Merk, Favidan, Rinnin, Veshir, Adamad, and Geleni gather animals and provisions and Renald begins working his two best scythes into polearms... the storm is coming! THE LAST BATTLE AND THE GOLDEN CRANE FLIES FOR TARMON GAI'DON!</p>

    <p><strong>Falendre.</strong> Sul'dam who was at the attack on Rand (lost his hand). After the debacle with the Dragon Reborn, the reremaining sul'dam and damane, Falendre and Nenci, Surya and Tabi, Malian, Ciar, and Talha have been moved via gateway to the Ebou Dar road outside the city. The bodies of Tanera and Miri are tied across horses. Nynaeve, Cadsuane, Merise and Logain are there, among others. Falendre is still trying to grasp the idea that Anath was really one of the Forsaken. Rand orders Falendre to take a message to the Daughter of the Nine Moons that he still wants a meeting. He will be in Arad Doman quelling the fighting against the Seanchan there.</p>

    <p><strong>Tylee.</strong> Hey hey, Tylee's pretty good with that sword! Taking a Trolloc out.. nice! So, Tylee (Seanchan Lieutenant General Tylee Khirgan) who fought with Perrin against the Aiel to get Faile.. lol She is a day away from Ebou Dar, she is from Maram Kashor, her ancestors might have come from here with Luthair Paendrag, she thinks. She lost few soldiers at Malden with Perrin's plan, because it worked so well. Ghosts are beeing seen, Karm the quatermaster, reported that a pack of rations turned to dust. Tylee thinks they are focusing on the wrong enemy. Galgan and Suroth have a single purpose, until Tuon unveils! Then a barbed arrow takes out Mishima and hundreds of Trollocs attack!</p>

    <p><strong>Graendal.</strong> ahh the plots! Graendal is in a palace in Arad Doman, right, at least that is what I'm to understand. Another hint that Sammael is actually dead, I don't know when I'll actually believe that lol. Graendal goes through the provided gateway to a black stone fortress in the deep northeastern Blight, she cools herself with Air and Water (weaves). Demandred and Mesaana enter - Mesaana is in the White Tower. She gets information from her agents in the White Tower and from Aran'gar with the rebels. Moridin spends his time gathering forces for the Last Battle while Moghedien and Cyndane rally Darkfriends to kill Mat and Perrin. She knows Semirhage is with the Seanchan so she knows the plans for everyone except Demandred. She thinks she would have heard from her spies if he were with the Borderlanders. Moridin enters.</p>

    <p>Demandred and Mesaana want to free Semi from Rand. Moridin says no. HOLY SMOKES. Mesaana must've had a spy at the Semi meeting, Moridin says she failed to capture him and disobeyed orders in harming him so no rescue. THEN MORIDIN FLEXES HIS LEFT HAND!! LATER GRAENDAL SAYS MORIDIN LOOKS LIKE RAND IF HE STANDS A CERTAIN WAY!! So my prediction is Moridin / Ishi are the other that Rand sees in his mind... since the balefire crossing? But I don't have more info than that, but that is interesting Moridin flexes his left hand.... that nugget has been tucked away.</p>

    <p>Mesaana says the WT is nearly broken and Demandred says his rule is secure. Moridin and Graendal talk and says her presence was a reward for her good work - Rand is coming to AD to restore order, she is to prevent that, not to harm him but bring pain of heart, frustration and anguish.</p>

    <p><strong>Rodel Ituralde.</strong> OH WHOA! Ituralde prepares to face a SC army of 150,000 outside the city of Darluna. Lidirn, an offer, is with him after Jaalam Nishur was killed in one of their last battles. Ituralde was dressed as a farmer to fool the C, Ituralde would have thought Darluna a grand city before he wne to fight the Aiel at Tar Valon! WHOA! SC army falls for the trap and Ituralde attacks!</p>

    <p><strong>The Prophet.</strong> DANG FAILE. DANG. Masema is with his remaining followers on a cliff near Malden, he is convinced Perrin is Shadowspawn. He thinks the Lord Dragon appeared to him last night and ordered him to kill Perrin. Prediction.. that wasn't actually Rand lol. Probably a Forsaken or maybe even Taim that Darkfriend..... Masema plans to escape from Perrin and rebuild. Faile and her Cha Faile show and Faile orders her bowmen to fire.. Masema is wounded and Faile stapbs Masema in the heart while she orders her followers to make sure that Perrin doesn't find out. WHOA!</p>
