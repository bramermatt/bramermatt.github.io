        <h2>Header</h2>
    <p>"Ravens and crows. Rats. Mists and clouds. Insects and corruption. Strange events and odd occurrences. The ordinary twisted and strange. Wonders! The dead are beginning to walk, and some see them. Others do not, but more and more, we all fear the night. These have been our days. They rain upon us beneath a dead sky, crushing us with their fury, until as one we beg: "Let it begin!" —Journal of the Unknown Scholar, entry for The Feast of Freia, 1000 NE"</p>

    <h2>Prologue, What the Storm Means, Wheel and Snake</h2>
    <p><strong>Renald Fanwar.</strong> Oh heck, this is why I love the Wheel of Time. A character we've never heard of before has an entire backstory that can be told in a few pages and we know what they're dealing with but they aren't exactly sure what's going on... so good! Renald Fanwar is a Borderlander farmer, seeing unnatural black and silver clouds come and go. His friend Gaffin thinks he's crazy. Thulin, a close blacksmith from Oak Water comes by in a loaded wagon with his wife Gallanha and daughter Mirala. They left everything behind and are "heading north". An army will be gathering and they need a smith. Renald's farmhands Merk, Favidan, Rinnin, Veshir, Adamad, and Geleni gather animals and provisions and Renald begins working his two best scythes into polearms... the storm is coming! THE LAST BATTLE AND THE GOLDEN CRANE FLIES FOR TARMON GAI'DON!</p>

    <p><strong>Falendre.</strong> Sul'dam who was at the attack on Rand (lost his hand). After the debacle with the Dragon Reborn, the reremaining sul'dam and damane, Falendre and Nenci, Surya and Tabi, Malian, Ciar, and Talha have been moved via gateway to the Ebou Dar road outside the city. The bodies of Tanera and Miri are tied across horses. Nynaeve, Cadsuane, Merise and Logain are there, among others. Falendre is still trying to grasp the idea that Anath was really one of the Forsaken. Rand orders Falendre to take a message to the Daughter of the Nine Moons that he still wants a meeting. He will be in Arad Doman quelling the fighting against the Seanchan there.</p>

    <p><strong>Tylee.</strong> Hey hey, Tylee's pretty good with that sword! Taking a Trolloc out.. nice! So, Tylee (Seanchan Lieutenant General Tylee Khirgan) who fought with Perrin against the Aiel to get Faile.. lol She is a day away from Ebou Dar, she is from Maram Kashor, her ancestors might have come from here with Luthair Paendrag, she thinks. She lost few soldiers at Malden with Perrin's plan, because it worked so well. Ghosts are beeing seen, Karm the quatermaster, reported that a pack of rations turned to dust. Tylee thinks they are focusing on the wrong enemy. Galgan and Suroth have a single purpose, until Tuon unveils! Then a barbed arrow takes out Mishima and hundreds of Trollocs attack!</p>

    <p><strong>Graendal.</strong> ahh the plots! Graendal is in a palace in Arad Doman, right, at least that is what I'm to understand. Another hint that Sammael is actually dead, I don't know when I'll actually believe that lol. Graendal goes through the provided gateway to a black stone fortress in the deep northeastern Blight, she cools herself with Air and Water (weaves). Demandred and Mesaana enter - Mesaana is in the White Tower. She gets information from her agents in the White Tower and from Aran'gar with the rebels. Moridin spends his time gathering forces for the Last Battle while Moghedien and Cyndane rally Darkfriends to kill Mat and Perrin. She knows Semirhage is with the Seanchan so she knows the plans for everyone except Demandred. She thinks she would have heard from her spies if he were with the Borderlanders. Moridin enters.</p>

    <p>Demandred and Mesaana want to free Semi from Rand. Moridin says no. HOLY SMOKES. Mesaana must've had a spy at the Semi meeting, Moridin says she failed to capture him and disobeyed orders in harming him so no rescue. THEN MORIDIN FLEXES HIS LEFT HAND!! LATER GRAENDAL SAYS MORIDIN LOOKS LIKE RAND IF HE STANDS A CERTAIN WAY!! So my prediction is Moridin / Ishi are the other that Rand sees in his mind... since the balefire crossing? But I don't have more info than that, but that is interesting Moridin flexes his left hand.... that nugget has been tucked away.</p>

    <p>Mesaana says the WT is nearly broken and Demandred says his rule is secure. Moridin and Graendal talk and says her presence was a reward for her good work - Rand is coming to AD to restore order, she is to prevent that, not to harm him but bring pain of heart, frustration and anguish.</p>

    <p><strong>Rodel Ituralde.</strong> OH WHOA! Ituralde prepares to face a SC army of 150,000 outside the city of Darluna. Lidirn, an offer, is with him after Jaalam Nishur was killed in one of their last battles. Ituralde was dressed as a farmer to fool the C, Ituralde would have thought Darluna a grand city before he wne to fight the Aiel at Tar Valon! WHOA! SC army falls for the trap and Ituralde attacks!</p>

    <p><strong>The Prophet.</strong> DANG FAILE. DANG. Masema is with his remaining followers on a cliff near Malden, he is convinced Perrin is Shadowspawn. He thinks the Lord Dragon appeared to him last night and ordered him to kill Perrin. Prediction.. that wasn't actually Rand lol. Probably a Forsaken or maybe even Taim that Darkfriend..... Masema plans to escape from Perrin and rebuild. Faile and her Cha Faile show and Faile orders her bowmen to fire.. Masema is wounded and Faile stapbs Masema in the heart while she orders her followers to make sure that Perrin doesn't find out. WHOA!</p>

    <h2>Ch 1, Tears from Steel, Dragon</h2>
    <p><strong>Rand.</strong> Whoa. This was HARD TO READ. Rand is losing control, and I feel so bad for him. This is so tough. That is interesting that the female channelers didn't help LTT..</p>

    <p>A wind rises around the White Tower and passes over the Alindaer Bridge and the town of Alindaer. Nearby is the rebel army numbering 50,000 whose Amyrlin, Egwene al'Vere, is held by the White Tower. The wind passes Dragonmount and over the Black Hills and Caralain Grass to Arad Doman. A countering wind from the north brings a stench of death. Rand and Min are in a log manor house in far eastern Arad Doman. His eyes are slowly getting better. He thinks of himself as hard as steel. He has been moving a lot since Lord Algarin's manor was compromised. Bashere's army is camped on the green near the house. He wears an unusual sword recently unearthed.</p>

    <p>Rand can feel that Aviendha is coming closer. She is with Rhuarc. He can sense Elayne and Alanna as well. Elayne feels relieved. Lews Therin moans about Ilyena and Rand thinks about what Semirhage said while impersonating the Daughter of the Nine Moons. 10 Asha'man, but Flinn, Narishma, and Naeff are full AM. Ituralde has been effective. Rand wonders if Graendal is still in Arad Doman as Asmo told him. He doesn't know what became of Asmo. Rand's goal is to fulfill his answer from the Aelfinn, that he must unite the south and the west, the north and the east. He intends to bring peace to Arad Doman and make a truce with the Seanchan.</p>

    <p>Cadsuane arrives with Nynaeve and Alivia. Min stiffens when she sees Alivia, as she always does, because of her viewing that Alivia will help Rand die. They have been questioning Semirhage. Rand will not allow torture on a woman, even one of the Forsaken, so they have learned nothing. Cadsuane suggests turning her over to the White Tower and Rand asks which one, Elaida or Egwene? Lews Therin grumbles about the women Aes Sedai not helping him, then moans about Ilyena. Rand shouts at him out loud and the others in the room stare at him. Rand is losing control. There may be nothing left of him to fight at Shayol Ghul. He should cry, but tears cannot come from steel.</p>

    <h2>Ch 2, The Nature of Pain, Flame of TV</h2>
    <p><strong>Egwene.</strong> Sheesh. Elaida has gone off the deep end, maybe she is just showing off in front of Egwene... maybe. So, Egween is still getting spanked, a lot. She is trying to embrace the pain as the Aiel do. Katerine and Barasine meet her to escort her to attend Elaida, Alviarin comes to get her punishment but she is late. As they're walking, in WOT fasion BOOM there is a wall in the way lol. The corridor dead ends at a mural of Caraighan Maconar ending the rebellion in Mosadorin, another change in the Pattern.</p>

    <p>Egwene decides her best option to deal with Elaida is silence. This is her first look at Elaida since she, Elayne and Nynaeve left the Tower to hunt the Black Ajah. Meidani is there. Elaida has her researching punishments for traitors. She jokes about demoting Shemerin. She does not believe the Seanchan are a threat and talks of a fourth Oath of obedience. Infuriated, Egwene dumps the soup bowl to keep from reacting. Meidani helps clean up and Egwene orders Meidani to send for her. Meidani agrees.</p>

    <p>In a rage, Elaida sends her out. She goes to the novice dining hall for dinner where she can hear Laras in the kitchens. She now realizes that Elaida will eventually destroy herself with her arrogance. Egwene's job is to hold the Tower together and keep it whole. She feels urgency for the White Tower to provide guidance for Rand. She returns to Silviana for another spanking, intending to visit Leane afterwards. She laughs when she realizes the pain of spanking is nothing beside the pain of the White Tower crumbling. Embracing pain is not about being hard; it is about understanding its insignificance. She reminds Silviana that Elaida's misguided orders only carry weight if Sisters accept them.</p>

    <h2>Ch 3, The Ways of Honor, Aiel</h2>
    <p><strong>Aviendha.</strong> My guess, her punishment is for her not staying with the Wise Ones. It seems to me all the Wise Ones stay together, talk together, sweat together - Avi is just running around doing things that a Maiden would do. Ah, I don't really know. Just glad to get more explanation on the ji'e'toh. SO Aviendha's spears were what makes up Rand's belt buckle, I think we knew that - still very cool to read!</p>

    <p>Avi, Rhuarc, Heirn, adn five other Maidens and True Bloods are scouting Domani refugees, this is the tenth band in less than a week. Rhuarc and Dobraine secured Bandar Eban and now the Aiel are scouting between there and Rand's manor. Aviendha is confused about her honor; she is no longer a Maiden but not yet a Wise One. Now the Wise Ones will not teach her at all and give her punishments. As they progress to Rand's manor, they meet up with two hundred other Aiel including Amys, Bair, Melaine and Nadere. Bair is only recently arrived. Amys grills Aviendha about her opinions on their work and about Rand and Min. Amys nods in agreement with Aviendha's opinions. She then gives Aviendha useless labor suitable for da'tsang as a severe punishment.</p>

    <h2>Ch 4, Nightfall, Wheel and Snake</h2>
    <p><strong>Gawyn.</strong> Hey, if someone had asked me how the White Tower siege was going to start from the rebels.. it wouldn't have been Gawyn. BUT from what it seems like here, I presume Gawyn is going to show himself in this rebel AS camp, he's going to learn of Egwene's capture and FREAKING STORM THE TOWER! At least that's what I'd want to read lol.</p>

    <p>So, Gawyn is with Jisao, Raja and 50 other Younglings. The clouds are higher than Dragonmount. They are scouting Gareth Bryne's soldiers in a small village. The soldiers are searching villages looking for the Younglings. Gawyn is being cautious. He does not understand why Bryne is here instead of in Caemlyn protecting Elayne. Gawyn struggles with his loyalties to Egwene, Elayne and the White Tower. There are only three hundred Younglings. They still survive against 50,000 troops only because Gawyn is so familiar with Bryne's tactics. Gawyn wishes he could see the sun again.</p>
