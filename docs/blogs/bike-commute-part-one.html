<h1 id="title">Bike Commuting to Work: Part One</h1>
<h3>June 25, 2022</h3>

<h2 id="writting">Part One</h2>
<p>If you know me, you know that when I get excited about a new hobby I jump in feet first! This is no different! I’ve never really wanted to bike before, or really thought about it. Until now..</p>

<p>My dad is an avid cyclist, and just today he rode 16 miles in under an hour! I’ve ridden bikes before, and I’ve enjoyed it. I never considered myself a cyclist, but I’m going to try and bike commute to work instead of driving!</p>

<p>If you look at the map pictured above, you’ll see that my drive is around 6 miles. To bike commute to work, that would be a total of 12 miles in total. I can safely say that I’ve never ridden 12 miles in one day in my entire life.</p>

<p>To complete the bike commute to work, I’m going to need to train my body to prepare for these new rides!</p>

<h2 id="training">Training</h2>
<p>Today, June 25, 2022, was the first day that I decided to ride my bike to get prepared. Now, I had the idea that I was going to ride my bike to work <strong>this Monday</strong>! My family had some concerns, and after my riding today, that is completely understandable.</p>

<p>Today, I took the handlebars to see if I could ride as long as I could. In total, I made it 3 miles! Obviously that’s not 12 miles. But it’s a start.</p>

<p>3 miles is good, I think.</p>

<p>This is Part One of a multi part blog series to follow my journey as I prepare to take my commute to work, with a <strong>bike instead of a car</strong>!</p>

<p>This is my bike, all I know is it's a Cannondale Mountain bike</p>
