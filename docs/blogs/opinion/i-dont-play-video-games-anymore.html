    <h2>I Don't Play Video Games Anymore</h2>
    <p>I wish I did. I just recently unplugged my PS4 for, quite possibly, the last time. I was there on DAY ONE for the PS4 Release in 2013! November 28th to be exact. I have loved videos games for all my life. I used to play games with my brother, we originally had a Playstation 1 and then Playstation 2, then we got an Xbox 360 for Christmas one year. I LOVED VIDEO GAMES!</p>

    <h2>Middle School</h2>
    <p>I used to play video games every single day. I'd get out of school, back when I was in middle school, and I'd play Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 with my bestfriend Isaac. And I mean, everyday. I'd get home and we'd play for hours! Then I'd eat dinner, and I'd come back and play more. I'd play so much that I was grounded from the Xbox! My grades were failing and it was because of video games. Eventually I brought my grades up and I was able to play video games again. My grades never plummeted again!</p>
    
    <p>I played so much Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2. SO MUCH. I put so many hours into that game. It was so good. Then Call of Duty Black Ops, then Modern Warfare 3, then Black Ops 2, then Advanced Warfare, then Black Ops 3, then Infinite Warfare. SO MUCH CALL OF DUTY!</p>
    
    <p>I also had a GIGANTIC LOVE FOR MINECRAFT! I also played so much Minecraft, and that took over my life for sometime as well. And that still holds a special place in heart.. I love Minecraft.</p>

    <h2>My Wife</h2>
    <p>Eventually I got married to my wife, Sandy, and I played less video games. But, my job at the time allowed me some playtime! I wasn't in College at that time, so I had even more time to play! I also loved Gameplay videos on YouTube. I eventually got into games besides Call of Duty, those that involved more story and more third-person gameplay. That was were gameplay really came into some fun!</p>
    
    <h2>Here comes the PS4!</h2>
    <p>I fell in love with story-telling in video games. Games like, The Last of Us, God of War, Marvel Spider-Man, Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order, Batman Arkam Knight, Infamous Second Son, Watch Dogs, Red Dead Redemption 2 (OH RED DEAD REDEMPTION 2!!!).</p>

    <p>I mean I legitimately filmed every second of my Spider-Man PS4 playthrough! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL08MpV1abFwLNGkb3k9pt7k0DtELGiNJh" target="_blank">Link</a>!</p>
    
    <p>I reviewed some of these games in a Google Sheets, find that <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Da_BjNaB8aXZIzssFCgtaQUDUTdFzxSw/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=110466285420924525876&rtpof=true&sd=true" target="_blank">here</a>!</p>

    <h2>My Son Was Born</h2>
    <p>Since my son, Everett, was born in 2020 I haven't been playing many video games. I went out and purchased a Nintendo Switch, I was excited to play Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, and I played a bit of it. I keep trying to get back to that game, but like I started with I don't play video games anymore. Since getting my Switch, I have played less and less of my PS4, because I have the ease of use with the Switch. I played some Rocket League on the Switch, that was a lot of fun! I love playing Mario Kart with my son, we have so much fun with that. I also played a bit of Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga... I loved that when I played on the Xbox 360, at one point it wasn't the Skywalker Saga. I played a lot of that then, and I'm enjoying it on the Switch. Again, I don't play very much anymore.</p>

    <p>I'm an adult with a family, a full-time job, I lead worship at our church, I preach sometimes at our church, and I'm still in college, so I need to prioritize my time more wisely. My son was diagnosed with Epilepsy in March and that has taken a mental tole on me and it's been a struggle to even do school work or prepping for teaching at church. A lot of my time is spent sleeping, when I typically would do that work. When I am in between classes, I would play video games.. but now, I don't. I also work on this website, I love programming and I'm excited to do that as a career, so a lot of my time is spent on that too!</p>

    <h2>Now I Read</h2>
    <p>Oh my, my, my, do I love reading! I also, if I have time, I read! I took up reading a few years ago and now I read so much! I try to read at least once a day, everyday! I am currently reading (the wheel of time series) and you can check out my reviews <a href="../../../html/reviews/franchise/wheel-of-time-in-review.html">here</a>, and I am 6 books in of a 15 book series. So reading takes up a lot of my video game time. And I am certainly not sad about not playing video games when I'm reading, because I love reading. I love reading.</p>
    
    <h2>Will I Play More?</h2>
    <p>I want to play, I love video games, I love learning about new video games, I love listening to video game news, I keep up on Twitter and YouTube with news. So, I don't know if I will play more. I have never played any Mario games, and with the Switch, I know I can do that, so eventually I might do that. For right now, I won't be playing many games.</p>
