<h2>What am I currently reading?</h2>
<p>So, I'm currently reading <a href="https://www.brandonsanderson.com/" target="_blank">Brandon Sanderson</a>'s <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17332218-words-of-radiance" target="_blank">Words of Radiance</a>. Book Two in the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/49075-the-stormlight-archive" target="_blank">Stormlight Archive Series</a>. This is going to be a massive series, 10 full books not including any additional books which I'm going to talk about in a bit.</p>

<p>I found Brandon Sanderson earlier this year, which really kicked off my whole love of reading in the first place. And I've always been a fan of science fiction and fantasy. But, I truly didn't realize how big of a fan of fantasy I was, until I read <a href="../../reviews/wok-review.html">The Way of Kings</a>, being Book One in the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/49075-the-stormlight-archive" target="_blank">Stormlight Archive Series</a>.</p>

<h2>How to Choose?</h2>
<p>So, I have come to a lot of deliberation, and communication with the Brandon Sanderson community. First of, there are an incredible amount of resources for this community.</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.brandonsanderson.com/" target="_blank">BrandonSanderson.com</a>: Brandon's Official Site</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.17thshard.com/" target="_blank">17th Shard</a>: The Official Brandon Sanderson Fansite</li>
    <li><a href="https://discord.com/invite/aZs23zqw?utm_source=Discord%20Widget&utm_medium=Connect" target="_blank">17th Shard Discord Server</a>: Brandon Sanderson Community all in one place</li>
    <li><a href="https://coppermind.net/wiki/Coppermind:Welcome" target="_blank">The Coppermind</a>: Comprehensive Wiki about Brandon Sanderson's Work</li>
</ul>

<p>And that's just to name a few.</p>

<p>With all of those places to do research on what to read next, I decided that I'd choose one series, instead of reading multiple. I've read so many different things this year, and only two other Brandon Sanderson books, so I've got a lot to go.</p>

<p>This year has been a whirlwind for myself and my family, and what book to read next is a very low priority thing, considering all that has happened. But, reading is now one of the great joys in my life.</p>


<h2>And, Next is..</h2>
<p>Here is the order of books, unless I decide otherwise after I write this, that I'll be reading after I finish Words of Radiance is:</p>

<ol>

    <img src="../../../img/blogs/books/warbreaker.jpg" alt="wb">
    <li>
        <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1268479.Warbreaker" target="_blank">Warbreaker</a>
        <p>This is a prequal to the entire Stormlight Archive, however it is not in the reading list for Stormlight Archive if you do your own research, but it has some connections to the whole of Stormlight Archive. I've heard this is not too essential for reading to understand the Stormlight Archive, but will add some fun understanding when particular things are read in the Stormlight Archive.</p>
        <p>This was also the real deliberation point. I've gotten conflicting responses when asking where or when to read this book as I read the Stormlight Archive. Ultimately, I've decided, since I've already read The Way of Kings (book one) and I will complete Words of Radiance (book two), that it is as good a time as any to complete Warbreaker then.</p>
    </li>
    
    <img src="../../../img/blogs/books/edgedancer.jpg" alt="ed">
    <li>
        <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34703445-edgedancer" target="_blank">Edgedancer</a>
        <p>A Brandon Novella here, 272 pages! A concise story to my understanding, but a vitally important story that is actually in the order as book 2.5 for the series.</p>
    </li>
    
    <img src="../../../img/blogs/books/oathbringer.jpg" alt="ob">
    <li>
        <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34002132-oathbringer" target="_blank">Oathbringer</a>
        <p>A book, I hear, is incredible! Truly all of the Stormlight Archive is incredible, but this book is specifically Dalinar's book, people say. This is the proper order now.</p>
    </li>

    <img src="../../../img/blogs/books/dawnshard.jpg" alt="ds">
    <li>
        <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54511226-dawnshard" target="_blank">Dawnshard</a>
        <p>Oh boy, Dawnshard. This one I am very excited for. I love the magic systems in the Stormlight Archive and I am always craving more. Dawnshard is supposed to be a very important book in the series. Also, only 171 pages.</p>
    </li>
    <img src="../../../img/blogs/books/rhythm.jpg" alt="row">
    <li>
        <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49021976-rhythm-of-war" target="_blank">Rhythm of War</a>
        <p>Book Four, might I say more? Yes, I will. This one is the longest of the series so far! Each previous book has never been longer than around 1000 pages, <em>this book</em> is a whopping 1232 pages! So much Brandon, this is going to be good.</p>
    </li>
</ol>


<h2>That's a lot</h2>
<p>So yes, that is a lot. A lot of reading, a lot of story, a long time to get through this all. You'd probably not be surprised but I also have about 12 other books currently on my bookshelf <strong>to read</strong>, not including the books I just mentioned. So, I'm going if I'm going to be solely focusing on the Stormlight Archive, it must be a good series. And yes, it is one of the most amazing stories I've ever consumed. The characters, the world, the story, the writing, everything is amazing.</p>


<h2>Stormlight 5</h2>
<p>A couple of things here, regarding Stormlight Archive Book Five. So, something about the Stormlight Archive series, in book one The Way of Kings, there was a prelude and a prologue before the book actually started. Those has both been pretty criticized by readers who have turned away from the series.</p>

<p>However, for those of us that love the story even more for that, each book has added a different perspective to that opening prologue. And Stormlight Five is no different. Brandon has released the Stormlight Five Prologue because he is currently writing book five. But, he has a lot of other work to do: secret projects, and other series as well.</p>

<p>You can read the prologue <a href="https://www.brandonsanderson.com/prologue-to-stormlight-5/" target="_blank">here</a>! And, if you'd like even more information on Stormlight Five read Brandon's <a href="https://wob.coppermind.net/events/502-stormlight-five-updates/" target="_blank">Stormlight Five Update One</a>.</p>


<h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>
<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
