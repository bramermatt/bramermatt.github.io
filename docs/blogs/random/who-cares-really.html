<h1 id="title">Who Cares, Really?</h1>
<h3>July 4, 2022</h3>
<img src="../../../img/blogs/random/who-cares.webp" alt="who-cares">

<h2>I Care, Do You?</h2>
<p>The inevitable question that is to arise, after you spend your time working on creating something that you're proud to present. That time comes, you are prepared to show it off, and you do.. then the receiver <strong>does. not. care.</strong></p>

<h2>How are you supposed to feel?</h2>
<p>For me, that does not stop me.</p>

<p>That actually makes me want to keep going. I have made this website by myself, without anything in return. Yeah, I've got a few people that say, "Hey I saw your site! Looks good!" But is that why I'm doing this? <strong>no</strong>.</p>

<h2>This is for ME</h2>
<p>I'm creating and developing these things for me. Now that I have children, I could say that I'm making these things so that they could see them after I'm gone; and maybe that's my underlying goal. But, for now, this is all for me.</p>

<h2>I can say "I did it"</h2>
<p>I'll never get the views or the clicks or the likes to really <em>make it</em>, and that's okay. That's not what I'm meant to do. I'm meant to be happy, and that's just what I'm going to be.</p>

<h2>Don't Worry, Be Happy</h2>
<p>What a song that is, but it's so true. You've got to believe in yourself, because if no one else does, you're all that's left! Not to say you don't have supporters, but it's up to you to truly know if you're happy.</p>

<p>Be happy. Create. Release. Enjoy life.</p>
