<h2>National Novel Writing Month</h2>
<p>November is National Novel Writing Month, and the organization NaNoWriMo can help!</p>

<p>I recommend checking out there website: <a href="https://nanowrimo.org" target="_blank">NaNoWriMo Website</a>, because there is so much good information there for you.</p>

<h2>What Am I Writing About?</h2>
<p>I've had this idea kicking around for a long time now, about a boy named Will Monitor and his hunt for the Infinite Scroll. I even have a website specifically set up for this: <a href="https://willmonitor.mattbramer.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Will Monitor Site</a>, I haven't updated this for a while now. But this was something that I was really interested in a couple of years ago and never went back and touched. Now I've read a lot more books and have some interesting ideas that I'd like to workshop.</p>

<p>I <em>might</em> be posting progress updates to the site, but I might just do a dump at the end of the month for everything that I've done. I'm actually really interested to see if I get any work or any real progress done. My wife did just give birth to our daughter two weeks ago now.</p>
