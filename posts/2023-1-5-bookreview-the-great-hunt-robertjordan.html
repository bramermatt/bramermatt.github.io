<blockquote>The Great Hunt by Robert Jordan - Book Review on YouTube</blockquote>

<div>
<h2>Written Review</h2>
<p>Oh wow, eee, wow! This book is amazing. SO many things happen in this book that make this book great. This is a great sequel to The Eye of the World, at that. I've been with these characters for so long already - 1400 pages now! And so much has already happened to all these characters, I care about them, I want to see what happens next, I want to see what changes with these characters of 15 books. I am also a big fan of the way Robert Jordan writes. He is very descriptive, and a lot of reviewers say that RJ is too descriptive, but I love it - now, I've not read all 15 books but I'm really loving it right now. Mat has become my new favorite character, I didn't really like him at first, I felt he were a bit of an annoying character with nothing to say - but now, I cannot wait to see what happens with Mat. Hopefully he can be saved. I can't wait to read book three - The Dragon Reborn!</p>

<details>
    <summary>And Now, I want to Spew Spoilers!</summary>
<p>Okay, let's spoil!</p>

<h2>Thom</h2>
<p>THOM! Thom is alive, and is even more awesome than he was in the first book - I love the leveling up that the Two River folk and how we get to talk to someone who we've not seen in a long time. I love that the character that we get to talk to is Thom, I love Thom! I am almost certain we are going to see more of Thom… hopefully.</p>

<h2>My Love of Fantasy</h2>
<p>I do really love that the Two River folk are leveling up and getting better at things and learning new things. Obviously that would happen, but that's why I love reading fantasy and it makes me so happy to read things like this - stories of characters who get better and we follow them for a LONG TIME.</p>

<h2>Sword Forms</h2>
<p>I really enjoy reading the way RJ writes his fight scenes, with the Sword Forms without much else - it is great..</p>

<h2>THE HORN</h2>
<p>I could not believe that the horn would be blown in this book - because the prophecy says the Horn is tied to who blows it and it must be at the Last Battle. And now, apparently it's tied to Mat? I have no idea - I guess I MUST READ AND FIND OUT!</p>

<h2>The Dragon</h2>
<p>Here it is.. Rand is the Dragon Reborn and I can't wait to see more of him pronouncing himself as the Dragon Reborn. I cried here - when Artur Hawkwing asked if Lews Theron had his banner.. Oh man I'm about to cry right now. THIS IS SO AWESOME. Wow, what a story.</p>

<h2>Heron Marked Sword</h2>
<p>Okay, let's talk about the sword. I don't know much about the sword on the image of the Dragon Reborn cover but I'm guessing it's going to be Rand's new sword? It's all white. But, the Heron Marked Sword was such a big deal for the first two books and now Rand (DRAGON REBORN) has TWO HERONS on his body. Oh wow, this story is amazing….</p>

<h2>Ingtar</h2>
<p>Oh man.. A Darkfriend. I couldn't believe this. I knew something was up with him the way he talked about the Horn. I had no idea this was going to happen and it hurt so much - but I feel his death was awesome. Hurin and everyone wanted to save him. So sad.</p>

</details>

<h2>Review Score</h2>
<p>Without a doubt a 5/5. Amazing. The ending really was incredible. I couldn't believe this book could get better and then the ending RAMPED UP!</p>
